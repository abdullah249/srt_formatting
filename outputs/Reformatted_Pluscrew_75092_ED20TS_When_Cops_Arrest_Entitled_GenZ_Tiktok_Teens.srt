1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:01,220
I have to sleep in jail?


2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:02,439
No!


3
00:00:02,779 --> 00:00:07,299
In a world where viral fame and privilege
often go hand in hand, what happens when


4
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:11,260
entitled teens raised on instant
gratification find themselves


5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:16,399
face-to-face with the law? Little do these
entitled Gen Zers know going viral isn't


6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:19,739
always a good thing, especially when it ends
with the click of handcuffs.


7
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:22,639
Crash, crash, crash, five, uh, five-eight
and-


8
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,619
I want your name and badge number, bro.


9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,319
Hey, bro.


10
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:25,519
Come


11
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:26,219
on.


12
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:27,219
Oh.


13
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:31,059
I knew something was gonna happen 'cause I'm
18 and I didn't know what to do.


14
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:33,760
I should have never [censored] dealt with
her.


15
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:38,520
Today, Detective Dale walks us through five
cases where entitled teens face the


16
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:40,339
consequences of their behavior.


17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,239
In June 2024, a Dairy Queen received an
online food order


18
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,079
exceeding $200. Shortly after, a woman called
the store to report


19
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,340
fraudulent use of her credit card after
receiving a bank alert about an


20
00:00:54,459 --> 00:00:57,479
unauthorized transaction at Dairy Queen.


21
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:02,519
When three individuals, including 17-year-old
Shemar tried to pick up the online order, the


22
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,119
store refused to hand over the food. But that
wasn't the only consequence of their illegal


23
00:01:07,139 --> 00:01:07,859
activity.


24
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:08,799
Stay in the vehicle.


25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:11,759
Stay in the vehicle!


26
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,739
When officers arrived at the Dairy Queen,
they were pointed towards the teen's car.


27
00:01:18,899 --> 00:01:22,039
They immediately tailed them and initiated a
traffic stop.


28
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:22,199
siren ]


29
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:30,039
M-81 with it. 6500 block of Meinecke.


30
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:35,559
Driver, put the vehicle in park. Stay in the
vehicle.


31
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,199
Stay in the vehicle!


32
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:41,359
We got one running


33
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:46,999
eastbound. I'm with the car. Southbound 65
from Meinecke, black male, black top, black


34
00:01:47,059 --> 00:01:48,739
pants. I'm with the vehicle right now.


35
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:50,719
206 is going after him.


36
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:56,899
Driver, open the window now!


37
00:01:57,099 --> 00:02:01,879
The officer noticed how the car brake
activated while ordering the running teen to


38
00:02:01,899 --> 00:02:02,599
return.


39
00:02:09,519 --> 00:02:11,559
Vehicle just took off, vehicle just took off.


40
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,159
Putting in pursuit for suspicious activity.


41
00:02:15,279 --> 00:02:17,099
North on 65 from Meinecke.


42
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:28,639
2026, we're through north, or through right
northbound. Speeds are 56.


43
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:29,839
No traffic.


44
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:34,799
Driver al-... Well, that one's 10's. Coming
up the center right now. Standby.


45
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,479
Crash class 65 in center.


46
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:41,119
I have to leave it.


47
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,639
63, 65 in center.


48
00:02:46,839 --> 00:02:49,419
I'm at 65 in center. Whoever's chasing has
been-


49
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,299
While the officer stopped to aid the vehicle,
Shemar's car just hit while fleeing.


50
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:58,119
The other officers followed Shemar on wild
goose chase.


51
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,579
263 is 10-47-1, turning eastbound on Lloyd.

Eastbound, speeds are 60.


54
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:13,439
I don't know why I'm doing this.


55
00:03:13,499 --> 00:03:15,619
Continue eastbound traffic's light.


56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,719
50 yards, I mean, it's past 60, cut through
almost to 60.


57
00:03:21,139 --> 00:03:22,119
Suspicions.

00:03:27,179 --> 00:03:31,259
49, I have it eastbound on Lloyd. Gonna be
going northbound on 59.


59
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,099
Technically a one-way, no other traffic.

Speeds are about 50. Continuing northbound,
coming up to Garfield

65
00:04:09,699 --> 00:04:14,279
Passing an oncoming traffic. We're two green.

66
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,979
Still eastbound coming up to 51. Slowing for
the red.


67
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:31,139
Still through the... Still eastbound on North
from 51. Speed's about 45.


68
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:36,879
Uh, medium traffic. Eastbound North from 49
coming up to Lisbon.


69
00:04:41,979 --> 00:04:43,859
Through the red eastbound at Lisbon.


70

Sherman. Through the green at Sherman and
North 45.

00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:08,419

Still westbound on Meinecke from Sherman.
Speeds are about 50.


78
00:05:38,739 --> 00:05:41,359
Went through the stop sign at about 47.


79
00:05:41,859 --> 00:05:46,599
With the high speeds, it's no surprise what
happened when he tried to make a sharp turn.


80
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:50,439
Still continuing westbound on Meinecke.
Coming back up to about five-eighth.

Crash, crash, crash, five, uh, five-eight and

Roll with him. Roll over. Roll over. Do it.

Get on the ground. On the ground.

00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:30,109
All right, all right, all right.

00:06:30,109 --> 00:06:31,109
On the ground.

All right. Just let me go.


90
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,309
On the ground.


91

00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:57,289
Yeah, I'm grabbing. Relax. Right here. Around
the corner, around the corner.


98
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:05,889
Did you grab my teeth? Did you grab my teeth?
Yep, it's right there. Did you grab them?


99
00:07:06,669 --> 00:07:09,269
Hold on, hold on. No, this is it. He's in
cuffs. Yep. Okay.

We'll grab them.

No.


103
00:07:17,049 --> 00:07:17,649
You're not injured?


104
00:07:17,709 --> 00:07:18,069
No.


105
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:20,669
I'm gonna roll you over, okay? You got
anything on you, boss?


106

No.


107

You don't have anything on you?


108

No.


109
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:24,629
Okay. You're not injured at all, okay?

00:07:25,289 --> 00:07:26,369
Okay, I'm gonna sit you up.

Just sit up, all right? Catch your breath.


112
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:30,469
Can you put that in my mouth? My grill.


113
00:07:33,789 --> 00:07:35,289
Can you put the grill up my mouth?


114
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:40,049
I'm not doing anything. We're going to make
sure it goes with


115
00:07:40,049 --> 00:07:40,349
you.


116
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:46,449

Yeah, 2419, 49.

All right, you good? Can you stand up?


119
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:54,169
All right, let's change you up.


120
00:07:56,369 --> 00:07:57,549
My whole thing's broken.


121
00:07:57,949 --> 00:07:58,529
That's mine.


122
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,529
While searching the teen, the officer found
someone else's credit card and driver's


123
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:06,029
license, which was later confirmed stolen.


124
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,889
That's all I want. I'm not resisting or


125
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:12,569
anything. Let me grab his stuff.


126
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,689
You're not injured at all, are you? Okay.


127
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:22,789
You guys got a pack?


128
00:08:22,949 --> 00:08:23,129
Huh?


129
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:24,209
Where is his pack, right here?


130
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:26,329
No, he came from that alley, I got him right
here.


131
00:08:26,329 --> 00:08:29,429
63, we're gonna walk him southbound out to
Meinecke.


132
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,609
Right over here, right around here.


133
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,749
We're taking him with the car. That's mine,
yeah.


134
00:08:36,709 --> 00:08:39,469
Thank you. Appreciate it.


135
00:08:41,109 --> 00:08:41,449
Oh, yeah.


136
00:08:41,449 --> 00:08:42,409
I'm really sorry about that man. Thanks. It
was locked though. I remember it being


137
00:08:42,449 --> 00:08:43,609
locked. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We noticed it was
locked.


138
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:44,849
Oh, yeah.


139
00:08:52,609 --> 00:08:54,749
They're- they're burn- they're burning right
now. He's- he's right here. Walking back with


140
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:55,129

wasn't going to shoot me? That's why I pulled


141
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:55,569
off. When you first pulled up, someone
already... Y'all just pulling up like this.


142
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:59,269
Bumpus as it is. Y'all ain't have to put your

143
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:01,729

144
00:09:02,509 --> 00:09:03,549

145
00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:15,049
I


146
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:51,829

148
00:09:52,769 --> 00:09:53,129
Okay.


149
00:09:53,849 --> 00:09:54,149
No,


150
00:09:55,149 --> 00:09:57,369
we got information the car you're in is
stolen, that's why.


151
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,449
That car's not stolen.


152
00:09:58,469 --> 00:09:58,749
Okay.


153
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,549
Well, yeah. We'll check. That's my mom's car.


154
00:10:01,829 --> 00:10:03,029
Okay. Sound good.


155
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,909
We're watching you get out of the crash. The
crash into the car isn't stolen.


156
00:10:08,209 --> 00:10:10,189
It's a rifle, 16 wires.


157
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:14,369
Yeah, I got one of them. Here, spread your
feet.


158
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:19,589
All right. Can you see my license and car for
me?


159
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:21,629
[police radio]


160
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:25,249
Did y'all grab my shoes? There's all but one
in that backyard, that black shoe.


161
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:26,949
They're all down.


162
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:28,269
Could you put it on my foot?


163
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:30,889
Could I get that one on my feet?


164
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,049
Yeah, give me one second.


165
00:10:34,089 --> 00:10:35,889
Thank you. Is that all his stuff?


166
00:10:36,029 --> 00:10:36,689
Yeah, there's his ID


167
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,129
back there, minus the shoe that I re-sold.


168
00:10:40,369 --> 00:10:41,649
Oh, okay. No, he locks in the arts.


169
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:42,889
Somebody else's right here.


170
00:10:43,969 --> 00:10:45,669
So if you look at it, they're just looking at
me thinking that way.


171
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,549
Perfect, thank you.


172
00:10:50,469 --> 00:10:59,309
Go


173
00:10:59,349 --> 00:10:59,609

174
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:06,109
Was it your vehicle that crashed or an
unoccupied vehicle or?


175
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:10,109
Can you roll down the window for me? Yeah.
Huh? Close the contact. I'm trying.

I'ma go, go find his phone and shit. Yeah,

bond.


180
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:32,669
However, this case is still far less
troublesome than the next one on the list.


181
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:36,709
Take that vest off for me, come on. Take that
vest off, you know. Look, come on, take that

complex regarding a disturbance in the
parking lot.


185
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:50,149
The caller stated that there was a large
group of juveniles drinking alcohol and


186
00:11:50,189 --> 00:11:54,709
loitering in the area. When officers arrived
on the scene, they found approximately


187
00:11:54,869 --> 00:11:58,829
15 to 20 subjects in and around several
vehicles.


188
00:11:59,249 --> 00:12:03,369
Hey, what's up? Huh? What's wrong with you?


189
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:05,229

Your partner here like he's gonna do
something. He ain't gonna do shit.


219
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:40,859
Where do you live, man?

00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:41,959

Oh, my. [footsteps thud]


239
00:13:01,979 --> 00:13:02,839
Put your hand behind your back.


240
00:13:03,499 --> 00:13:05,979
Put your hand behind your back. Stop
resisting. Put your hand behind your back.


241
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:06,299
I'm clear.


242
00:13:06,299 --> 00:13:08,139
Put your hand behind your back. Stop
resisting.


243
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:08,419
Come on.


244
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:09,199
Stop resisting.


245
00:13:09,819 --> 00:13:09,959
No.


246
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:10,679
Put your hand behind your back.


247
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:11,579
I didn't do anything.


248
00:13:11,579 --> 00:13:12,539
Put your hand behind your back.


249
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:13,619
I'm a minor.


250
00:13:14,439 --> 00:13:14,459
Hey, y'all.


251
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,119
So why'd you get in my face? What, were you
gonna hit me?


252
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:16,739
No, sir.


253
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:17,059
Huh?


254
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:17,819
Oh, yes, sir.


255
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:18,539
Hey, man.


256
00:13:18,539 --> 00:13:19,679
So why'd you get in my face then?


257
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:20,119
Now, why are you-


258
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:21,619
I told you stop balling up your fist, right?


259
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:22,319
I did. I apologize.


260
00:13:22,319 --> 00:13:23,579
Okay, so why'd you get in my face?


261
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:24,199
I wasn't doing anything.


262
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:24,479
All right, stand up.


263
00:13:24,479 --> 00:13:25,119
It's not me too, sir.


264
00:13:26,599 --> 00:13:26,899
Hey. Hey.


265
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,779
What you doing? Hey, back up.


266
00:13:28,899 --> 00:13:33,219
While the cops handle him, another teen comes
forward and creates a scene.


267
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,679
What you doing? Back up. Back right now. The
f- you doing, bro?


268
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,319
Back up. It's no big deal.


269
00:13:38,719 --> 00:13:38,819
Ah, hell no.


270
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,639
It's no big deal.


271
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,339
Roll up on your side. Stand up.


272
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:42,459
What you doing, bro? Did he slap you?


273
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:42,659
Stand back.


274
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,179
Get back right now. Back up. Back up.


275
00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:46,159
God damn. I got him. I got him right here.


276
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,479
What's wrong with y'all, man? Ah. What's
wrong


277
00:13:49,779 --> 00:13:50,239
with y'all?


278
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,099
Nice try. Back up.


279
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:53,479
Hey, back up. Back up now.


280
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,519
Oh my God. Hey, where are you going?


281
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:00,559
It's all good. I didn't do nothing. No, it's
no big deal.


282
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:04,139
Okay, it's no big deal. It's no big deal. Sit
down.


283
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:05,399
Tell me.


284
00:14:06,019 --> 00:14:06,859
It's no big deal.


285
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:09,939
Stop it. Do me a favor. Do me a favor.


286
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:14,899
It's no big deal. Hey, Joey, bro. I ain't do
nothing. Come on, bro.


287
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:15,959
I'm gonna try and help him.


288
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:20,019
Joey. Stop. Stop. What the f- You let the man
go to jail?


289
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:22,939
It's not... I didn't have constraints. It was
just work on him.


290
00:14:23,419 --> 00:14:24,619
I didn't do nothing, bro.


291
00:14:24,619 --> 00:14:26,539
[laughs] And you were about to hit me, dude.


292
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,339
I was not about to hit you.


293
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:29,159
So why'd you ball your fists and get in my
face?


294
00:14:29,239 --> 00:14:30,939
Because, dude, you were running up on me.


295
00:14:30,979 --> 00:14:31,959
Yeah, okay, okay.


296
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,839
I didn't hit you. Give me a break, you little
bitch.


297
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:35,219
I don't care what's going on with him to
begin with.


298
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:36,159
Step out. Step out of-


299
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:37,879
Hey, give me my keys, bro.


300
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,559
I'm sorry. I was just hyped up. Dude,


301
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,219
I respect it.


302
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:45,699
4-10-4, I know he's got a lot of subjects
here. We got one 10-15.


303
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,179
Over here. Right up here.


304
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:49,159
Why's he going to jail right now? Why's he
going to jail?


305
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,519
If you get on his face, I'm a sit in here.


306
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,159
I'm not on your face, bro.


307
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,799
I'ma sit as closest to him as I can.


308
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:54,159
Exactly. And you're gonna have a problem with
him, huh?


309
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:54,999
That's three feet of space.


310
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:55,399
Oh, you're a bitch, bro.


311
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,679
Go stand over there right now.


312
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:00,379
You's a bitch, bro. You bitch-made, bro.
You're bitch-made.


313
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:02,939
No big deal, bro. It's no big deal. Trust me,
it's not a big deal.


314
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,799
It's still early.


315
00:15:06,979 --> 00:15:10,479
We gotta call Riley. That's the brother of
this 10-15. Just make sure he stays away.


316
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:12,939
Listen, I am sorry.


317
00:15:12,939 --> 00:15:15,079
I told you several chances. I said, "Hey,
stop balling your fists.


318
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:15,999
Chill out."


319
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:16,679
I apologized.


320
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:18,159
All right, I accept your apology-


321
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:18,179
Seriously, I apologize


322
00:15:18,179 --> 00:15:19,919
... but you, we didn't have to take it to
this level, man.


323
00:15:19,979 --> 00:15:21,779
No, I know. I'm sorry. I was just hyped up.


324
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:25,119
It's like tw- it's like 15 of you guys and I
let you punch me in the face? Whoa, damn.


325
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:25,699
I apologize. I didn't mean to punch your
face.


326
00:15:26,439 --> 00:15:29,519
Well, you looked like you were gonna hit me.
I know and I apologized. I apologize.


327
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:32,639
All right. Why'd you ha- wha- what's all the
ball, balling up your fists?


328
00:15:32,719 --> 00:15:36,919
Sorry, chill. I'm just hyped up. I don't
know. Crazy situation going on, sir.


329
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:37,959
Honestly, I apologize.


330
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:38,739
Yeah, but listen, man.


331
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:39,039
I am sorry.


332
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,099
Listen, man. Listen to me.


333
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:40,299
I'm sorry.


334
00:15:40,299 --> 00:15:45,119
Any, any time you come across police, you
ball up your fists and get at somebody's


335
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,159
face, I'm not... You know, what do you think?
I'm a, I'm a punching bag?


336
00:15:47,159 --> 00:15:48,139
I'm gonna let you punch me in the face or-


337
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,119
No, I know, sir. Trust me.


338
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:49,379
Okay, so-


339
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:52,559
If you were to tase me, I would understand,
truthfully. Like, you got me in my ribs a


340
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:52,619
couple times. Yeah, you did.


341
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,099
It's fair.


342
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,179
Dude, yeah, because-


343
00:15:54,259 --> 00:15:55,139
And you got me a couple times, right?


344
00:15:55,139 --> 00:15:58,339
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know what, what
your dig is, but I appreciate you calming


345
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,859
down and- Look, like, man to man, I'm sorry.


346
00:16:01,059 --> 00:16:01,399
Okay.


347
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:01,919
You got me right. [crosstalk]


348
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:02,879
Okay, I have... Listen,


349
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:05,199
it's not personal, man. I'm, I'm doing my
job.


350
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,679
I, I appreciate you being sorry, but you
know, you, you screwed up. Okay.


351
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:11,179
I just want to say I apologize. Yeah, I
apologize. I was acting big and tough. I up.


352
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:11,279
I


353
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:12,379
got, I got


354
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,119
drunk on the ground.


355
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:14,579
Okay.


356
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:15,519
It was my mistake.


357
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,599
No problem. Stand by real quick. Do you have
anything else in your pocket that you worry


358
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:19,379
about? No? Sir, you can check me anyways.


359
00:16:19,439 --> 00:16:19,599
Okay.


360
00:16:19,599 --> 00:16:20,659
I'm sorry and I apologize.


361
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:21,039
You're good.


362
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:24,379
Well, I, I respect you as a man for, you
know,


363
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,999
saying you're sorry, but-


364
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:27,079
That's what I'm saying, man to man. I'm
sorry.


365
00:16:27,099 --> 00:16:28,759
What do we gotta do? Have a seat for me.


366
00:16:29,099 --> 00:16:29,459
Right here?


367
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,459
No, over here. Over here on the floor.


368
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:33,199
Yeah, that, that's all right. I'm right here.
Okay, why don't...


369
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,579
We'll, we'll call or do whatever needs to be
done.


370
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:35,899
Okay.


371
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:38,939
All right, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna explain to
you right here


372
00:16:38,939 --> 00:16:42,919
what's going on. Okay.


373
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:47,679
After putting him in the vehicle, the
officers disclose everything that's happened


374
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:49,179
to his father. We don't need this other one,
do we?


375
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:50,439
No, no.


376
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:51,979
Just keep him over there?


377
00:16:52,099 --> 00:16:53,679
Yeah, just keep him away. He was


378
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:56,059
two seconds away from joining him.


379
00:16:56,059 --> 00:16:58,739
[laughs] Sorry about that.


380
00:16:58,759 --> 00:16:59,779
No, no, you're good, man.


381
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,919
This is your house number or your cell phone?


382
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:03,759
My cell phone.


383
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:09,399
Okay. So here's your stuff back. Like I
explained to you, unfortunately, right now,


384
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:11,499
he's gonna be arrested for what he just did.
All right, they're gonna-


385
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:13,499
Wait, wait, what's the charge, out of
curiosity?


386
00:17:13,719 --> 00:17:15,579
I'm gonna talk to the other officer and
exactly find out what the-


387
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:15,739
I think it's larceny.


388
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:18,419
... what these exact charges are. But
regardless, he's gonna be taken down.


389
00:17:18,419 --> 00:17:21,479
Do you know where the Juvenile Assessment
Center is? On 45th Street, just past the


390
00:17:21,479 --> 00:17:21,939
hospital. It's like fifth and up.


391
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:23,139
Yeah. You know where the road tracks are?


392
00:17:23,159 --> 00:17:23,539
Yeah.


393
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:28,279
That's where the Juvenile Assessment Center
is. So what's gonna happen is he's gonna get


394
00:17:28,539 --> 00:17:30,519
taken down there. They're gonna process him.
And then, uh-


395
00:17:30,899 --> 00:17:31,239
Why juvenile?


396
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:32,839
How old is he?


397
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:34,939
20.


398
00:17:35,259 --> 00:17:35,979
He's 20 years old?


399
00:17:36,099 --> 00:17:36,299
Yeah.


400
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,579
Uh, someone over there said he was 16. If
he's 20, then he's going down to county jail.


401
00:17:39,719 --> 00:17:40,379
Okay.


402
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:43,499
All right? So regardless, you can call down
there in a few hours.


403
00:17:43,499 --> 00:17:45,379
They'll figure out how you can get him home,
right?


404
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,219
Yeah.


405
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:47,899
So, all right?


406
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,079
It is what it is, right?


407
00:17:49,259 --> 00:17:51,359
Are you good with keeping him calm? He's not
gonna be an issue for you?


408
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,259
No, I got him. I got him. Can I say one thing
to my son before he leaves so he doesn't


409
00:17:54,259 --> 00:17:54,859
freak out? I'll let him know.


410
00:17:54,879 --> 00:17:56,059
Just crack the window. I don't have to see.


411
00:17:56,059 --> 00:17:58,999
Well, I'll let the other officer know, 'cause
your, our supervisor will talk to him.


412
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,399
Then before they leave, I'll let you know.


413
00:18:00,399 --> 00:18:00,759
They only took a second.


414
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:02,819
No, no, before they leave, I'll let them know
you wanna talk to them, all right?


415
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,259
I just wanna make sure you're good with your
other son, okay?


416
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:06,699
Yeah. I am, but


417
00:18:07,479 --> 00:18:08,999
I'm pissed off.


418
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:13,665
... if we can find out a charge for him,
maybe to cool him down a little bit.


419
00:18:13,665 --> 00:18:14,265
He's good.


420
00:18:14,326 --> 00:18:16,545
I think it's probably resisting arrest or
something like that.


421
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:19,085
They, they've only been brothers, and
they've, they've been together, 'cause I


422
00:18:19,085 --> 00:18:19,106
wasn't around for a while. And-


423
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:19,226
All right


424
00:18:19,226 --> 00:18:19,326
...


425
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:20,626
and they only have each other. They only have
each other.


426
00:18:20,626 --> 00:18:23,786
It's, it's probably a misdemeanor... it's
probably a misdemeanor resisting arrest


427
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,446
charge. He was wanting to know. He's fired up
about it.


428
00:18:29,446 --> 00:18:34,025
No, I want to be out here. No, I don't care.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm not doing


429
00:18:39,846 --> 00:18:42,686
anything. Just kidding. Not happy we're here.
Normally, we're


430
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:42,926
Oh.


431
00:18:45,346 --> 00:18:46,485
Oh, I remember this house.


432
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:50,125
Only ever had with each other, since I wasn't
around for a few years.


433
00:18:50,526 --> 00:18:52,825
So, they're very tight. That's all they have.


434
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:57,686
Like I said, it's probably a misdemeanor
resisting arrest charge. I don't know the


435
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:58,265
whole ins and outs of it. Yeah.


436
00:18:58,485 --> 00:19:01,985
Uh, we just can't have him fighting around
with you guys or, or with your grandma.


437
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:03,385
No, he's not. He's just upset about his
brother.


438
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:03,905
I hear you.


439
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:07,045
If I could just speak to him for a second
before he goes, he can let me know?


440
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,545
We'll, we'll try to figure that out here in a
minute.


441
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:10,105
Or do it now, it takes like three seconds.


442
00:19:10,105 --> 00:19:13,925
I did... I'm not the one in charge over
there. I don't know what's going on. I... if


443
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:18,465
he's... if he did something, for us to have
supervisors out here, it's probably something


444
00:19:18,485 --> 00:19:20,305
that he needs to sit there and think about
what he did for a minute, okay?


445
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,605
Uh, so they don't wanna cooperate. They
didn't say anything.


446
00:19:22,645 --> 00:19:22,845
No.


447
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:26,785
They said they saw, but then they were like,
"No, we ain't got nothing to say." So, all


448
00:19:26,805 --> 00:19:27,805
right, then if you have nothing to say, then
get out of here.


449
00:19:27,885 --> 00:19:30,305
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-


450
00:19:30,305 --> 00:19:31,625
Yeah, that's a practical thing.


451
00:19:32,685 --> 00:19:32,725
Like, handle it.


452
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:34,705
Multiple uncooperative witnesses.


453
00:19:36,605 --> 00:19:39,525
All right. Well, I'm sorry I had to turn out
this way. It is what it is.


454
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:42,005
If you were a police officer, you'd probably
understand why I had to do what I had to do.


455
00:19:42,005 --> 00:19:43,485
I was raised around police officers.


456
00:19:43,545 --> 00:19:45,365
So, sir, do you have your license with you?


457
00:19:45,365 --> 00:19:46,125
Yeah, I already gave it to him.


458
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,685
Oh, you guys walking? Thank you. Alrighty.
Uh, you wanna talk to him real quick?


459
00:19:48,685 --> 00:19:48,785
Yeah.


460
00:19:48,845 --> 00:19:51,285
He's... I'm gonna end up taking him to the
house, and then he's gonna take a ride, okay?


461
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:53,205
No, I'm calm down. No,


462
00:19:54,345 --> 00:19:57,685
I'm not getting out. I just want... Can, can
I stand up and at least say goodbye?


463
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,005
No, no, no, you can't get out of the car,
man. You gotta stay there.


464
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:00,165
They lost their baby.


465
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,025
Are you arresting me?


466
00:20:01,245 --> 00:20:02,485
Yeah, you're, you're arrested right now.


467
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:02,985
For what?


468
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:03,525
Temporary.


469
00:20:03,545 --> 00:20:04,025
What'd I do?


470
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:05,465
For assaulting a law enforcement officer.


471
00:20:05,505 --> 00:20:06,985
That is not an assault, I never touched him.


472
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:08,525
Okay, well, you were about to, that's why
it's assault.


473
00:20:08,525 --> 00:20:09,625
No, I wasn't about to.


474
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:10,325
Honey, honey, honey.


475
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:11,625
Okay, well, I'm not gonna argue with you,
man.


476
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:14,785
Listen, it can go to court and they can throw
it out, if that's what it takes.


477
00:20:14,785 --> 00:20:17,085
Well, obviously, this guy kicked me in his
ribs.


478
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:18,525
No, he's, uh, he's actually halfway decent.


479
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,585
No, I know he's... he is, he is half-decent,
he is decent.


480
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:24,725
Dude, I gave you more than... I gave you so
much respect, and you know it, man. I gave


481
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,465
you more than... I gave you so much respect,
and you know it, man. I gave you respect so


482
00:20:27,465 --> 00:20:28,385
much. Not really. Like, I had like two
seconds. I obviously seen how he was upset.


483
00:20:28,385 --> 00:20:29,385
When you get older, buddy, you're gonna
learn. And then when I tried to


484
00:20:29,485 --> 00:20:30,485
Get one in there.


485
00:20:30,585 --> 00:20:31,445
How many... yeah, listen, man, how many times
did I try to tell you, "Hey, relax.


486
00:20:31,445 --> 00:20:32,625
You stop balling up your fists"?


487
00:20:32,845 --> 00:20:34,865
Like, maybe once. I'm sure it's on your body
cam now.


488
00:20:34,885 --> 00:20:38,265
It's all on body cam. That's the, that's the
great thing about having a body cam, it's all


489
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,645
on body cam. That's the, that's the great
thing about having a body cam, it's all on


490
00:20:39,725 --> 00:20:40,185
body cam. That's the, that's the great thing
about having a body cam, it's all on body


491
00:20:40,185 --> 00:20:42,705
cam. That's the, that's the great thing about
having a body cam, it's all on body cam. I


492
00:20:42,705 --> 00:20:44,865
know, that's what I'm saying, though. He's
not 100% okay. It's okay, man. I'm not here


493
00:20:45,205 --> 00:20:46,405
to argue with you, I'm just here to speak to
your dad real quick. I know he's not one of


494
00:20:46,425 --> 00:20:46,605
those. I can tell he's not one of those. Look
at me, I've met many of them. I know he's not


495
00:20:46,605 --> 00:20:48,345
one of those. Look at me, I've met many of
them. I know he's not one of those. So have


496
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:50,805
I, I know he's not one of those. That's all
I'm saying, but I'm trying to explain to you,


497
00:20:50,825 --> 00:20:51,205
like- Yeah, man


498
00:20:51,205 --> 00:20:51,225
...


499
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,285
can you at least readjust my cuffs? One of my
hands is cuffed.


500
00:20:54,285 --> 00:20:56,465
I, I am, I'm gonna do all of that before we
leave here.


501
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,145
Can, can, can I have my brother come and
stuff to say goodbye to my brother?


502
00:20:59,145 --> 00:21:00,865
No, no, no, we can't have everybody come say
goodbye.


503
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:01,905
So it's just one person?


504
00:21:01,905 --> 00:21:05,005
Yeah, just your... um, it doesn't even have
to be your dad. I'm just doing your dad the


505
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:06,605
favor. Tell me, tell me mom's number so I can
remember it.


506
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:07,445
Oh, God.


507
00:21:07,445 --> 00:21:08,405
All right.


508
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:09,405
Thank you. I appreciate it.


509
00:21:09,465 --> 00:21:09,845
Have fun.


510
00:21:09,845 --> 00:21:10,345
More than anything.


511
00:21:10,345 --> 00:21:10,925
Anytime, bro.


512
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:12,065
Watch your leg.


513
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:14,745
Tossing your terms.


514
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:16,085
Yeah, you know,


515
00:21:16,765 --> 00:21:19,805
dad's a decent dude, but kid made a... kid
messed up.


516
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:24,805
Naturally, they claim to have no idea why an
arrest is taking place.


517
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,525
Do you even know what you were called for?


518
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,405
Called for like disturbance or what? Like, I
know a s- decent amount about cops.


519
00:21:31,405 --> 00:21:32,925
Something like that. One of your neighbors
called.


520
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,685
A neighbor called for a disturbance?


521
00:21:35,245 --> 00:21:35,985
Yeah, something like that.


522
00:21:36,065 --> 00:21:41,045
But why did y'all go after him? He was... Of
course he's gonna stand against cops. What am


523
00:21:41,085 --> 00:21:42,165
I saying? That's enough.


524
00:21:43,665 --> 00:21:46,925
What happened, man? Why, why the outburst
tonight?


525
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,685
Well, I, I was just upset. Like, there's a
lot going on.


526
00:21:50,105 --> 00:21:50,305
Yeah.


527
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:53,065
Obviously, I wasn't gonna touch him. You
know, I had so much time to touch him.


528
00:21:53,065 --> 00:21:54,385
I would have if I wanted, you know.


529
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:54,825
Okay.


530
00:21:54,985 --> 00:21:55,485
It's just, I,


531
00:21:56,105 --> 00:21:57,285
like, I was just being stupid.


532
00:21:57,285 --> 00:22:00,545
Well, what... We came here for a noise
complaint and then it went south really


533
00:22:00,545 --> 00:22:04,465
quick. Yeah, we, we were all just around and,
like, I don't know, I just got upset. And


534
00:22:05,045 --> 00:22:06,225
then I... You been drinking and stuff or?


535
00:22:07,085 --> 00:22:08,025
You been drinking a little bit?


536
00:22:08,185 --> 00:22:08,465
No.


537
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:09,085
Sure?


538
00:22:09,365 --> 00:22:13,425
Yeah, I'm certain. Test me whatever you want.
I haven't had a single drink. I haven't had


539
00:22:13,425 --> 00:22:17,205
nothing. Okay, all right. Very good. So, a
bunch of people are saying that, like, you


540
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,785
got in the officer's face and stuff, and told
him to take his fist off.


541
00:22:18,785 --> 00:22:22,225
Well, we, we were close. Yeah. Like, I was
talking shit, I'll admit, but that's just


542
00:22:22,225 --> 00:22:25,045
talking shit, I'll admit, but that's just
talking shit, you know? If I... I had so much


543
00:22:25,285 --> 00:22:26,945
time to touch him. If I was gonna touch him,
I would've touched him. You know, I was just


544
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:27,905
talking shit. I'm stupid. What were you
saying to him?


545
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:29,585
Like, I...


546
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,605
I don't even remember. It all happened so
quick. I was just talking shit.


547
00:22:32,605 --> 00:22:33,805
Like, I was just frustrated that-


548
00:22:33,965 --> 00:22:34,165
Okay


549
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:36,985
... 'cause every time cops come over here,
they're just, like, complete assholes.


550
00:22:36,985 --> 00:22:38,885
So, I was just flustered. Like, I was hanging
out with my friends.


551
00:22:38,885 --> 00:22:43,585
The boy was charged with assault on an
officer and carrying a concealed


552
00:22:43,605 --> 00:22:48,105
weapon. A few girls proved that it's not just
rowdy guys that are the problem.


553
00:22:48,405 --> 00:22:49,365
Are you proud of me?


554
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:50,725
Come on, speaking.


555
00:22:50,765 --> 00:22:55,705
Officers responded to an incident at an
overflow parking lot where a female driver


556
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:58,745
was found unresponsive inside a running
vehicle.


557
00:22:58,865 --> 00:23:03,585
Upon inspection, officers discover that a DUI
charge isn't the only one


558
00:23:03,765 --> 00:23:04,745
she'll be facing.


559
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:07,905
My dad pays for everything for me. He's... he
has money.


560
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:09,845
If he needs to pay you, he can pay you.


561
00:23:09,965 --> 00:23:11,865
These are the events that followed.


562
00:23:13,965 --> 00:23:18,405
Face down. Got too busy with her, kick her to
the point where we use her for a chase. Yo.


563
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,985
Hello. Sheriff's office. Go get it.


564
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:22,505
Can you turn it off for me?


565
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:23,285
10-4.


566
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,945
There you go. Yeah, turn the engine off.
Don't, don't drive off on me. Step out for


567
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:27,665
me. Step out for me. 10-4.


568
00:23:30,345 --> 00:23:31,265
How old are you, young lady?


569
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:32,245
19.


570
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:35,325
Damn, girl. Was anyone else in the vehicle
with you, or are you by yourself this whole


571
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,165
time? No, I was just going down to 19 Bar.


572
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,425
What? What 19 Bar?


573
00:23:39,745 --> 00:23:41,165
Um, the strip.


574
00:23:42,085 --> 00:23:43,585
We were, we were just staying here.


575
00:23:43,965 --> 00:23:44,505
Who's we?


576
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,945
My friend J- Jade. We're staying the night
here.


577
00:23:48,045 --> 00:23:49,125
Where's your, where's your friends at?


578
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:49,785
Um...


579
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:51,685
There's nobody in the car but you.


580
00:23:52,425 --> 00:23:53,565
They told me to wait here.


581
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,005
Where are they? Are th- are they in their own
car?


582
00:23:56,085 --> 00:23:56,625
Yes.


583
00:23:57,525 --> 00:24:02,365
So, based on watching you pass out at the
wheel and the alcohol that's in the vehicle


584
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:06,065
and the alcohol that's in the vehicle and I
can smell it, and your swaying as you're


585
00:24:06,145 --> 00:24:10,445
standing there, I, I suspect that you're
under the influence. To dispel my concerns


586
00:24:10,505 --> 00:24:12,125
that you're under the influence. To dispel my
concerns that you may be operating a motor


587
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:14,425
vehicle under the influence of alcohol, would
you submit to field sobriety evaluations? I'm


588
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:17,565
just waiting on them. They told me to wait
here. That's not what I asked you. I asked


589
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:18,825
you if you would submit to field sobriety
evaluations. These are tools that help me


590
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:19,205
determine- I don't feel comfortable.


591
00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:22,565
The purpose of a field sobriety evaluation is
to help me determine your level of impairment


592
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:23,045
and if you should be operating a motor
vehicle.


593
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:24,065
I don't feel comfortable.


594
00:24:24,325 --> 00:24:24,485
Okay.


595
00:24:24,485 --> 00:24:24,845
No, I don't.


596
00:24:25,065 --> 00:24:25,425
Okay.


597
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,005
I don't feel comfortable driving.


598
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:29,345
No, no, I didn't ask if you were a
comfortable driver.


599
00:24:29,985 --> 00:24:30,965
Let's try this again. You ready?


600
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,779
Yes.


601
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:35,559
All right, I need you to open up the mirrors
for me. Listen to my question, okay?


602
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:40,640
I suspect that you are under the influence of
alcohol, and that you're impaired, and that


603
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:41,179
you should not-


604
00:24:41,179 --> 00:24:41,279
No, I'm not


605
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,039
... be driving a vehicle. To help me
determine if I'm correct or not, will you


606
00:24:46,179 --> 00:24:47,340
submit to field sobriety evaluations? Okay.


607
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:47,799
I don't.


608
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:48,760
Okay, okay.


609
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:52,499
'Cause my house is just right there. I just,
I, I'm not comfortable.


610
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,799
You're not comfortable what?


611
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,459
With the law. Like, I'm just really-


612
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:56,879
Am, am I making you uncomfy?


613
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:59,819
It's not you, it's just, like, how the world
is today.


614
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:00,559
I know.


615
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:00,859
Like, I'm just, I'm just-


616
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:02,679
Goddamn TikTok told you to fear the cops-


617
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:02,699
Yes, yes


618
00:25:02,699 --> 00:25:06,699
... and now you, that, so, so social media
tells you the cops are bad, and now you're


619
00:25:06,719 --> 00:25:06,899
out here scared of the cops?


620
00:25:06,899 --> 00:25:09,440
It's not you guys. No. It's, it's just like-


621
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:13,580
Well, would it surprise you that if you were
drinking in the safety of a hotel room or


622
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:17,519
your room or with your friends, and you
weren't driving your vehicle that I probably


623
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,899
would never had any contact with you? So,
what you should say is you should say like,


624
00:25:19,899 --> 00:25:20,940
"You know what? Society is wrong."


625
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,399
I trust-


626
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:26,019
"And I should not have been in my vehicle
with alcohol and drinking and


627
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:29,039
driving. I should not be doing that. But the
cops are really good."


628
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:29,680
Yes.


629
00:25:29,719 --> 00:25:32,519
You see what I'm saying? So you shouldn't be
uncomfortable, you should be uncomfortable


630
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:32,839
with your actions.


631
00:25:32,839 --> 00:25:35,339
No, my parents are fine with this, like,
they're just like-


632
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:36,899
Your parents are fine with what?


633
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:37,859
Driving myself.


634
00:25:37,899 --> 00:25:39,239
They're okay with you drinking and driving?


635
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,739
No, like, as long as it's, like, okay with,
like, my, my person, myself, this right now,


636
00:25:44,999 --> 00:25:45,959
probably not. What do your, what do your
parents do?


637
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:49,559
Uh, my dad was in the Army for, like, 10
years.


638
00:25:50,099 --> 00:25:52,739
And is that your main drink right there?


639
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,659
Oh, I haven't had that 'til nine o'clock
tonight. I promise.


640
00:25:56,659 --> 00:25:56,979
[laughs]


641
00:25:56,979 --> 00:25:57,619
[laughs] Who's, uh,


642
00:25:58,399 --> 00:25:59,019
bag is that?


643
00:25:59,039 --> 00:25:59,479
That's not, that's not mine.


644
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:00,859
No, the bag on the right. Who's is that?


645
00:26:01,219 --> 00:26:02,319
That's not mine. That's my friend, Jade.


646
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:04,999
The, the bag's not yours? So, is, is that, is
Jade a male or a female?


647
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,319
Uh, she's a male. That's mine, but that,
that's not mine.


648
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,399
She's a male, or he's a male?


649
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:12,159
She's a male. She's gay, but that's not mine.
I, I, I promise.


650
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:13,439
What? So, it's actually a male?


651
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:13,959
Yes.


652
00:26:13,959 --> 00:26:15,039
That wants to be a female?


653
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:15,359
Yes.


654
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,279
So, you said she had to respect for the
whatever-


655
00:26:17,459 --> 00:26:17,919
Yes.


656
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:18,419
Okay.


657
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:20,999
But I promise I haven't had that since nine
o'clock tonight.


658
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:22,539
Well, what about the beer right there?


659
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:23,619
That's not mine. I don't drink beer.


660
00:26:23,619 --> 00:26:24,879
You just pointed, and you said it was yours.


661
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:25,799
Not mine.


662
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,119
So, what are you, what are you drinking
tonight?


663
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:28,779
I drank, uh, vodka cran.


664
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:31,559
So, so were you drinking at, at the splash
bar?


665
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:34,859
I was, but I stopped because I knew I had to
drink girls home.


666
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,019
'Cause they, they're gay, but I'm not gay, so
I don't drink.


667
00:26:38,679 --> 00:26:39,939
That's still cold-cold.


668
00:26:40,139 --> 00:26:40,219
Yeah.


669
00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:41,119
Hang on a second, okay?


670
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:44,039
I literally just wrecked a car like this
three months ago.


671
00:26:44,379 --> 00:26:44,599
So-


672
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:47,239
Wrecked, three deer, and I was, my dad was
like-


673
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,619
So, based on all my observations, I do
suspect you driving


674
00:26:51,219 --> 00:26:52,179
impaired. Okay?


675
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:52,679
Mm-hmm.


676
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:54,039
And you're under arrest for


677
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:57,179
driving while under the influence of alcohol
and/or drugs.


678
00:26:57,479 --> 00:26:57,859
Okay.


679
00:26:57,979 --> 00:26:58,659
Okay? So-


680
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:00,939
My house is just right there. Like, literally
right there.


681
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:02,339
I understand that, but


682
00:27:03,019 --> 00:27:04,579
you drove, you drove this vehicle.


683
00:27:04,699 --> 00:27:04,819
I, I understand.


684
00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:08,339
You made the decision to drink and drive. So,
we're gonna go through the motion.


685
00:27:08,439 --> 00:27:09,519
I think it's better to get a-


686
00:27:09,539 --> 00:27:10,679
I respect... Whatever.


687
00:27:10,999 --> 00:27:15,679
Well, I mean, you tell me what else you think
that I could've done. [phone rings] Who was


688
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:16,579
that? My friend.


689
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:16,839
Answer it.


690
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:17,679
It's literally right there.


691
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,179
Answer it.


692
00:27:19,059 --> 00:27:19,379
Hello?


693
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,859
Is that a sober person or not?


694
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:22,319
Are you sober?


695
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,879
Tell them to find you a sober driver.


696
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:26,499
Are you sober right now? If so, that'd be
great.


697
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,619
They said they're two minutes down the road
'cause we're waiting-


698
00:27:28,619 --> 00:27:29,759
Yeah, but are they, are they sober?


699
00:27:30,199 --> 00:27:33,979
Um, they, th- they just hung up but it's
right here. I could show you real quick.


700
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,819
Hey, h- um-


701
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:37,059
I have my office-


702
00:27:37,359 --> 00:27:40,659
To, to, to dispel any more concerns, will you
let me see what's in that bag?


703
00:27:40,699 --> 00:27:41,079
Yes.


704
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,639
Did you explain to them that they needed a
sober driver here immediately?


705
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:46,539
And this is the


706
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:48,879
male that wants to be a female?


707
00:27:49,199 --> 00:27:49,539
Yes.


708
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,799
The officer kept asking about the bag inside
the vehicle, but the girl refused to admit


709
00:27:54,819 --> 00:27:59,759
it was hers. This is the moment when her lies
started uncoiling, but it's just the


710
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:00,399
start.


711
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:01,539
... little shit, that's you.


712
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:02,399
Yeah, that's me.


713
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:03,279
This is your stuff.


714
00:28:03,519 --> 00:28:03,799
Yeah.


715
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:05,359
You said it was someone else's stuff.


716
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:07,979
No, I'm, I'm saying, like, my friend's coming
to get me here.


717
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:09,939
Is there something here illegal?


718
00:28:10,339 --> 00:28:10,679
No.


719
00:28:11,239 --> 00:28:12,659
So, why did you tell me it was someone else's
bag?


720
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,919
No, no, no, I'm saying, like, my friend's
coming.


721
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:15,819
You definitely


722
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:17,939
should probably take the ride, but I won't-


723
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:20,359
No, I'm saying, like, my friend's two minutes
down the road.


724
00:28:20,479 --> 00:28:22,019
Do you use any drugs besides marijuana?


725
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:22,399
No.


726
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:23,379
I use-


727
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,059
Are you in college?


728
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,079
Yeah, I am. I go to University of Southwa-


729
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:26,699
Do you make good grades?


730
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:31,319
Yes, I'm A strai- A straight student. I make
straight As.


731
00:28:31,479 --> 00:28:31,999
Straight As?


732
00:28:31,999 --> 00:28:33,039
Yes, straight As. I have a 4.0-


733
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,379
If you walk away from... Wh-


734
00:28:35,439 --> 00:28:35,459
who's-


735
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:37,719
My dad, my dad. My dad's the father of me.


736
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:38,219
[laughs]


737
00:28:38,239 --> 00:28:42,239
My dad, my dad pays for everything for me.
He's, he has money.


738
00:28:42,259 --> 00:28:44,219
If he needs to pay you, he can pay you.


739
00:28:44,459 --> 00:28:44,939
Oh, yeah?


740
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:45,499
Yeah.


741
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,119
I don't want him to pay me, I want him to
make you-


742
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:47,819
Yes, my dad-


743
00:28:47,819 --> 00:28:48,639
... make better decisions.


744
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:51,259
Yes, he, he does. He's very proud of me right
now.


745
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:51,599
He's ve-


746
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,039
He's very proud of you?


747
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:53,299
Yes. He's ve-


748
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,079
Call him on the phone.


749
00:28:54,179 --> 00:28:54,599
Okay.


750
00:28:57,639 --> 00:28:59,559
Hey, are you proud of me?


751
00:29:00,259 --> 00:29:00,919
Put him on speaker.


752
00:29:01,459 --> 00:29:03,599
Hey, you're gonna talk to my dad. You ready?


753
00:29:04,419 --> 00:29:06,199
Talk. Talk, Dad.


754
00:29:06,699 --> 00:29:07,699
Hey, what's going on?


755
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:08,319
Who is-


756
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:08,699
Mom.


757
00:29:08,719 --> 00:29:09,539
Law enforcement, Bopper.


758
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:10,739
Who am I speaking to?


759
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:11,219
Mom.


760
00:29:11,579 --> 00:29:13,539
This is Deputy Gober, the county sheriff's
office.


761
00:29:13,539 --> 00:29:14,139
Is this Ms.-


762
00:29:14,719 --> 00:29:15,319
Yes.


763
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:16,999
Go over.


764
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:20,019
Ah, you called, you called your friend. What
do you wanna do?


765
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,199
No, that's my mom.


766
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,119
That's, th- she said that she's a friend of
yours.


767
00:29:23,139 --> 00:29:23,199
Okay.


768
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:23,959
You called the wrong number.


769
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:27,459
We're g- we're gonna chalk this off to a
learning experience and get her


770
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:32,199
a sober driver with a valid license, and I'm
gonna tell her father what she's doing.


771
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,819
I'll work it if you want me to, I just, I
just-


772
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:34,119
Yes.


773
00:29:34,619 --> 00:29:35,319
You wanna go that far?


774
00:29:35,639 --> 00:29:35,959
Yes.


775
00:29:36,959 --> 00:29:38,259
No, that, that was my mom.


776
00:29:38,499 --> 00:29:43,219
You've already told me that you, you refuse
to do, um, field sobriety evaluations,


777
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,719
okay? Will you talk to this officer over
here? He's gonna ask you for a sample of your


778
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:48,299
breath to determine... Okay?


779
00:29:48,819 --> 00:29:53,739
My house is just right there. I'm just trying
to go home. I hate this. I'm sorry.


780
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:55,519
Come over here for me, please....


781
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:58,959
she's willing to give a sample of her breath.


782
00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:01,059
Okay. I wanna say-


783
00:30:01,099 --> 00:30:02,039
Am I going to jail?


784
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:02,899
[coughs]


785
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:04,419
I pay in cash.


786
00:30:04,499 --> 00:30:06,159
So, she provided two breath samples.


787
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:06,539
Okay.


788
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:06,879
Yeah.


789
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,399
Her birf- her first breath sample is a 2-2...
I think that's an eight.


790
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,639
And her second one was a 2-28.


791
00:30:12,699 --> 00:30:13,859
I'm just two minutes away.


792
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:14,799
How much do you weigh?


793
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:16,799
I'm only 140, like,


794
00:30:17,439 --> 00:30:20,899
48, 45. It just depends on what I eat that
day.


795
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:25,199
But I, I promise I'll, like, pay it. I
promise I'll learn my lesson. I understand


796
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:25,759
this. Like, my dad will pay it.


797
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:28,479
Does she not understand how above the limit
that she is?


798
00:30:28,499 --> 00:30:29,179
My dad will pay it right now.


799
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:31,879
Nah, I told her she's, like, three,
three-four times over the limit.


800
00:30:31,879 --> 00:30:32,019
My dad will pay it right now.


801
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:33,059
Bro, she's only 19 too.


802
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:33,079
She's 21.


803
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:35,499
I know, but I'll pay it right now. I'm just,
I just wanna


804
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,739
She's almost 21, and she only, she's only two
minutes past


805
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:38,699
time.


806
00:30:40,145 --> 00:30:43,306
When you fail a drug test, some people accept
their fate.


807
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:47,105
Others get embarrassingly desperate, like
she's about to.


808
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:48,405
Am I getting arrested?


809
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:51,785
I told you earlier you were under arrest.
[sighs] At least I can get my real handcuffs.


810
00:30:52,605 --> 00:30:53,365
Appreciate you, man.


811
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,145
It's fine.


812
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:54,485
Yep. Um-


813
00:30:54,705 --> 00:30:55,705
I, I'll get with you this weekend.


814
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:58,865
I'm literally two minutes away. Like, the-
they could just take me.


815
00:30:59,185 --> 00:31:00,065
Come on, you all right?


816
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:00,986
I'm sorry. [crying]


817
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,625
All right. You understand the severity of
this?


818
00:31:02,625 --> 00:31:04,906
No, I understand. Like, I understand all the
rules.


819
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,965
You're, you're three or four times over the
legal limit.


820
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:07,385
Yes.


821
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:08,526
And you got all that beer in your car.


822
00:31:08,526 --> 00:31:09,365
I have my friends.


823
00:31:09,425 --> 00:31:09,525
All right.


824
00:31:09,525 --> 00:31:10,305
I have my friends.


825
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,366
Okay, sit over here. Let's have a seat.


826
00:31:11,366 --> 00:31:11,385
[coughs]


827
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:12,385
[clears throat]


828
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:15,405
So-


829
00:31:15,705 --> 00:31:15,986
Buck-


830
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:19,425
... help me understand. Do, do you want, do
you want the vehicle to go with your friends


831
00:31:19,506 --> 00:31:20,285
or do you want me to have it towed for you?


832
00:31:20,285 --> 00:31:21,305
I want it with my friends.


833
00:31:21,305 --> 00:31:22,566
It's okay if I give it to your friends?


834
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:23,006
Yeah. [crying]


835
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:23,345
Okay.


836
00:31:24,326 --> 00:31:25,205
I'm sorry.


837
00:31:25,445 --> 00:31:26,885
Don't be sorry. People make mistakes.


838
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:31,705
It's my fault. Like, no, I'm literally two
minutes away. It's my fault. You know what?


839
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,165
It's fine. I understand the law. I respect
it.


840
00:31:34,346 --> 00:31:34,605
Peo- peop-


841
00:31:34,605 --> 00:31:35,725
I respect it. I made my-


842
00:31:35,846 --> 00:31:36,745
People make, people make mistakes.


843
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:37,145
My mistake. Yes.


844
00:31:37,425 --> 00:31:39,725
Okay? This doesn't make you a bad girl for,
for this.


845
00:31:39,725 --> 00:31:44,166
We- will I be able to, like, sleep in my own
bed tonight though? I ca... I have to sleep


846
00:31:44,966 --> 00:31:45,385
in my own bed tonight though? I ca... I have
to sleep in jail? No.


847
00:31:45,745 --> 00:31:47,045
It's probably just one night, okay?


848
00:31:47,065 --> 00:31:49,865
No, I have to pay. No, I'll pay. My parents
will pay.


849
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:50,845
Okay, well, let's just-


850
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,885
I can't... I have to pay. I can't do this. I
can't.


851
00:31:52,885 --> 00:31:54,485
Stay, stay, stay calm, okay?


852
00:31:54,985 --> 00:31:55,385
No way.


853
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,165
Stay calm with me.


854
00:31:59,165 --> 00:32:01,686
All right, she's three or four times over the
limit, so


855
00:32:02,805 --> 00:32:06,085
she is going to jail tonight. She's
requesting that you take possession of her


856
00:32:06,086 --> 00:32:07,865
vehicle. Do you accept that responsibility to
drive her vehicle?


857
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:08,245
Oh, I accept that, yeah.


858
00:32:08,245 --> 00:32:09,745
Okay. Come over here and get her vehicle
keys.


859
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:10,105
Okay.


860
00:32:13,225 --> 00:32:13,965
You wanna talk to her?


861
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:18,265
Can you get me from the sheriff office, like,
like, in literally, like, an hour?


862
00:32:18,385 --> 00:32:19,645
If your daddy has money.


863
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:20,625
Okay.


864
00:32:20,825 --> 00:32:22,145
I don't have money to bail you out.


865
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:23,845
Okay. Uh, I have money.


866
00:32:24,225 --> 00:32:24,825
That's my mama's money. It's not mine.


867
00:32:24,825 --> 00:32:29,285
C- Do y'all take credit card? I can't stay in
the office. I can't [censored] off in the


868
00:32:29,285 --> 00:32:34,225
office. I can't [censored] off in the office.
I can't. [gasps] I can't. I have money. I


869
00:32:35,085 --> 00:32:35,865
have money. I have money if y'all take credit
card. Take cred-


870
00:32:36,125 --> 00:32:36,525
Chill. Chill.


871
00:32:36,565 --> 00:32:37,885
I can't stand it.


872
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:40,245
Calm down.


873
00:32:40,285 --> 00:32:42,145
Just, just take my dad's credit card.


874
00:32:42,945 --> 00:32:45,385
He gives you permission. I promise he gives
you...


875
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:46,145
Okay. Chill out.


876
00:32:46,705 --> 00:32:47,825
I need her permission for what?


877
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:48,425
He does.


878
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,605
That's not dealing with questions


879
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:54,205
For bailing me out. [laughs] They don't care.
I promise they don't care.


880
00:32:54,585 --> 00:32:55,885
Did she call you on the phone earlier?


881
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:56,565
Yes, she did.


882
00:32:56,645 --> 00:32:56,665
Yes.


883
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:57,665
When I told her to call her parents?


884
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,545
Yes, and I said, "What's going on? What are
you working on?"


885
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:00,205
What's your, what's your last name?


886
00:33:00,205 --> 00:33:03,085
"So what's going on? Like, I want to know
what's going on."


887
00:33:03,085 --> 00:33:03,105
[coughs]


888
00:33:03,125 --> 00:33:03,525
Like, we all-


889
00:33:03,825 --> 00:33:04,385
No, this is fine.


890
00:33:04,425 --> 00:33:09,345
She's arrested for DUI, and she'll go to
jail, and then she'll have first appearance


891
00:33:09,365 --> 00:33:12,425
tomorrow, and then she'll be calling you for
a ride home, probably be... I mean, if I...


892
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:14,805
th- I... don't hold me to it. If I had to
guess, probably between 2:00 and 5:00 PM.


893
00:33:15,165 --> 00:33:17,865
Oh, my God. [laughs] [coughs]


894
00:33:18,825 --> 00:33:22,365
I'll pay $1,000 right now. Is that a fine?


895
00:33:22,585 --> 00:33:26,005
If I pay $1,000? No, "My parents will pay."


896
00:33:26,485 --> 00:33:26,985
Then shut the fuck up. You better shut the
fuck up.


897
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:28,465
No, they will pay right now.


898
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:28,665
[laughs]


899
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:29,945
I need to get out.


900
00:33:30,285 --> 00:33:34,265
During further investigation, the cops
discovered that her ID is fake.


901
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:35,685
That's not my ID.


902
00:33:35,685 --> 00:33:35,865
That's her fake ID?


903
00:33:35,865 --> 00:33:37,105
Call my dad right now.


904
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:37,845
That's her fake one?


905
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:38,925
He won't let me stay the night and get help.


906
00:33:38,925 --> 00:33:39,665
Where's her real one?


907
00:33:39,665 --> 00:33:40,285
I have no idea.


908
00:33:40,425 --> 00:33:41,265
Are you shitting me?


909
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:42,885
I swear on my life.


910
00:33:43,545 --> 00:33:43,565
Shitting me?


911
00:33:43,565 --> 00:33:44,965
Where did she get this fake ID?


912
00:33:45,825 --> 00:33:48,805
Online. We... It came with some socks.


913
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:52,145
Jesus Christ. I need her real ID. Come on,
let's go find it.


914
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:54,025
Oh, my God.


915
00:33:54,025 --> 00:33:56,445
[laughs] That's another charge by the way.


916
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:58,365
Oh, my God.


917
00:33:58,365 --> 00:34:00,085
You can't be in possession of a fake ID.


918
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,885
I know, that's why I've lost mine here.


919
00:34:01,885 --> 00:34:02,565
[laughs]


920
00:34:02,685 --> 00:34:03,685
Or did someone take it from you?


921
00:34:04,045 --> 00:34:06,065
Somebody did take it from me. [laughs]


922
00:34:06,065 --> 00:34:07,425
Why... What is wrong with y'all?


923
00:34:07,425 --> 00:34:09,005
I tried to go into Code Ugly, but-


924
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,665
Find, find her a real fucking ID, please. She
said in the back of the fanny pack, didn't


925
00:34:12,985 --> 00:34:13,405
she? Yeah.


926
00:34:13,925 --> 00:34:15,265
Aha! The plot thickens.


927
00:34:15,265 --> 00:34:15,685
You found it?


928
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,405
Her daddy's retired army?


929
00:34:17,665 --> 00:34:18,105
Yeah, his-


930
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:18,845
Is that the real one?


931
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,425
Yes, that is definitely the real one.


932
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,365
You silly ass girl. I am disappointed.


933
00:34:23,365 --> 00:34:24,625
[laughs] I am-


934
00:34:24,625 --> 00:34:24,645
[laughs]


935
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,645
[laughs]


936
00:34:25,745 --> 00:34:25,765
You're a cool cop, you know?


937
00:34:25,945 --> 00:34:25,965
Mm-hmm.


938
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:27,465
I fuck with you. Like, you're chill.


939
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:28,105
I am very-


940
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:30,265
I was very scared to come up here and see.


941
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:32,745
I am, I am very disappointed in... actions.


942
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:34,525
Can I please just-


943
00:34:34,565 --> 00:34:36,365
Sweetheart, you have a fake ID too.


944
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:36,385
No.


945
00:34:36,385 --> 00:34:39,665
You know that's, that's a crime to have a, a,
a fi- fictitious ID, right?


946
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:43,045
Can I please just stay with her? I'll pay you
$500. Please.


947
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:43,425
This person's really cute.


948
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:44,305
I just need a chance.


949
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:45,265
I don't, I don't want your money.


950
00:34:45,425 --> 00:34:46,065
Please. Can't...


951
00:34:46,065 --> 00:34:47,805
Here's the problem. Now I gotta do more
paperwork.


952
00:34:48,525 --> 00:34:50,845
Just do more paperwork. My parents will pay.


953
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:50,905
Mm-hmm.


954
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:52,125
I just need... [crying]


955
00:34:52,125 --> 00:34:53,225
You have to chill out, bro.


956
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:56,065
I have shit to take. [crying]


957
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:59,245
You're going to jail tonight. Listen, you're
going to jail tonight and you have to keep


958
00:34:59,365 --> 00:35:00,285
that in your mind. No, I can't.


959
00:35:00,745 --> 00:35:00,785
But you are.


960
00:35:00,785 --> 00:35:02,325
No, I can't, I can't, I can't.


961
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:03,845
You are. You're going to jail tonight.


962
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:05,545
You know what? It's fine.


963
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:05,705
You're going to jail.


964
00:35:05,705 --> 00:35:06,305
You know what? It's fine.


965
00:35:06,365 --> 00:35:06,685
You're going to jail.


966
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:07,565
I'm gonna sleep good.


967
00:35:07,785 --> 00:35:07,905
You're going to jail.


968
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:08,625
I'm gonna sleep good.


969
00:35:08,685 --> 00:35:08,865
You're going to jail, so you better keep it
together.


970
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:09,805
Will my parents know?


971
00:35:09,945 --> 00:35:09,985
Mm-hmm.


972
00:35:10,145 --> 00:35:12,045
I'm not taking the picture for it.


973
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:12,685
Yeah, you are.


974
00:35:12,725 --> 00:35:12,845
No way.


975
00:35:12,845 --> 00:35:14,165
It's a mugshot. You have to.


976
00:35:14,165 --> 00:35:16,925
No way. I can't have that on my record.


977
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:19,565
People at Inter- people in Enterprise are...
You are gonna have it on your record.


978
00:35:19,565 --> 00:35:19,625
They're gonna know who I am? [crying]


979
00:35:19,625 --> 00:35:21,845
It's a DUI. It's a DUI.


980
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,385
I'm not drunk.


981
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:24,665
Yes, you... Chill out, bro.


982
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,145
I'm not.


983
00:35:25,145 --> 00:35:25,185
Chill.


984
00:35:25,185 --> 00:35:27,565
No, like, the fact is I'm not drunk. That's
the thing.


985
00:35:27,605 --> 00:35:27,625
Chill.


986
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,785
I've told them so many times.


987
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:30,325
Chill out.


988
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:31,125
Take me to jail.


989
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:31,405
[coughs]


990
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:36,365
You know what? I don't care. Don't tell a,
don't tell anyone.


991
00:35:36,585 --> 00:35:37,745
I don't want my parents to know.


992
00:35:37,745 --> 00:35:37,765
No.


993
00:35:37,965 --> 00:35:39,525
Do you think my parents will find out?


994
00:35:39,785 --> 00:35:40,865
They will, for sure.


995
00:35:40,865 --> 00:35:41,745
How? How?


996
00:35:41,785 --> 00:35:42,705
Because you're going to jail.


997
00:35:43,045 --> 00:35:44,085
Going on a DUI?


998
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:45,445
Yeah, this is a DUI.


999
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,065
No, no way.


1000
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:46,845
This is not a DUI.


1001
00:35:46,885 --> 00:35:47,305
No way.


1002
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:51,645
You have to be so for real with yourself.
This is a DUI. You're fixing to go to jail.


1003
00:35:51,845 --> 00:35:53,445
Am I actually going to jail right now?


1004
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:53,805
Or


1005
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:55,405
can I pay you?


1006
00:35:55,405 --> 00:35:55,745
[coughs]


1007
00:35:55,745 --> 00:35:59,025
I'll literally pay. Like, I know, like, this
is sucks.


1008
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,745
I'm just not the type of person to go to
jail.


1009
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:04,625
Like, I have shit going for my life.


1010
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:09,685
Like, I'll literally pay whatever. Like, I
know this is, like, a sucky situation.


1011
00:36:09,685 --> 00:36:13,065
I'm not supposed to do this at all, but,
like, I'll literally pay whatever.


1012
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:16,525
Like, I'm literally two minutes away. Please,
officer.


1013
00:36:16,765 --> 00:36:19,625
You can watch her take me home. I'll go to
sleep.


1014
00:36:20,285 --> 00:36:21,065
Is that fine?


1015
00:36:21,205 --> 00:36:24,385
Okay. Very well. And you're taking possession
of the vehicle, so I'll lose.


1016
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,665
Yes, I have her keys right now.


1017
00:36:25,985 --> 00:36:27,625
They're... My parents are gonna be so mad.


1018
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:28,365
[laughs]


1019
00:36:28,365 --> 00:36:28,965
They're gonna be like-


1020
00:36:28,965 --> 00:36:28,985
God, they are


1021
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:29,785
... "Why didn't you pay it?"


1022
00:36:29,785 --> 00:36:31,225
Richard is gonna be pissed as fuck.


1023
00:36:31,225 --> 00:36:33,465
He's gonna be like, "Why didn't you pay it?"
Can I just pay it right now?


1024
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,125
No, you have to go to jail.


1025
00:36:35,565 --> 00:36:36,245
For how long?


1026
00:36:36,885 --> 00:36:37,945
Until you sober up.


1027
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:39,985
I'm fine. Excuse me.


1028
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:40,785
Mm-hmm.


1029
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:44,305
Can I pay it now and so I don't have to spend
the night? Is that possible?


1030
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:45,505
No.


1031
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:46,139
That's it.


1032
00:36:46,139 --> 00:36:49,819
Even if I- if, even if I pay 1,000? I'll
literally pay you.


1033
00:36:49,899 --> 00:36:52,579
You can get in trouble for bribing a- a- an
official to do that.


1034
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:54,160
Oh, shit. You're right. You're right. You're
right. You're right.


1035
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,099
[dramatic music] She was charged with DUI and
possession of a forged driver's


1036
00:36:59,139 --> 00:36:59,779
license.


1037
00:36:59,999 --> 00:37:04,699
Isn't it shocking how people try to get smart
with cops instead of sobering up and


1038
00:37:04,799 --> 00:37:08,379
admitting fault? Hats off to the cops for
dealing with such pathetic teens out there.


1039
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:13,379
Though this girl was a challenge, the next
case, which involves teens attacking a mature


1040
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,940
lady over some money, demonstrates how a few
teens are growing up with no respect for


1041
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:23,039
elders. But before we really look into this
case, please take a moment to subscribe to


1042
00:37:23,059 --> 00:37:24,119
our channel as Detective Dale moves to the
next story.


1043
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:25,579
Are you serious?


1044
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:26,079
Hey, guys. What's going on?


1045
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,639
I'm a whole nurse. Are you serious?


1046
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,859
On August 9th, 2024, officers responded to
reports of an altercation


1047
00:37:34,959 --> 00:37:37,799
involving a firearm at an apartment complex.


1048
00:37:37,939 --> 00:37:42,540
Upon arrival, police confronted a few teens
who apparently attacked a senior


1049
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:43,860
resident over rent.


1050
00:37:44,019 --> 00:37:45,040
I'm a nurse.


1051
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:45,660
Sure. [dog barking]


1052
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,620
I'm a nurse.


1053
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,719
These are the events that followed.


1054
00:37:48,959 --> 00:37:50,139
Federal Police!


1055
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,899
Get off me. [dog barking]


1056
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:52,859
Hey, who has a gun?


1057
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,719
Get outta here. [dog barking]


1058
00:37:55,719 --> 00:37:55,739
She's crazy.


1059
00:37:55,739 --> 00:37:56,759
Hey, separate.


1060
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:57,979
Oh my God. Good.


1061
00:37:57,979 --> 00:37:59,460
I don't give a fuck. [censored] good.


1062
00:37:59,739 --> 00:38:00,640
Hey, who had the gun?


1063
00:38:00,819 --> 00:38:01,279
No one...


1064
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:02,699
They have a gun. It was her. It was her.


1065
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,259
Get away. Hey, stay right there.


1066
00:38:04,399 --> 00:38:05,560
They have a gun. They have a gun and they
want to kill me.


1067
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,119
Come back here. Come back here. Come back
here.


1068
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,159
Stay right there.


1069
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,000
She stole rent money. She saw my lease-


1070
00:38:12,059 --> 00:38:12,319
Okay


1071
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:13,259
... and she took my rent money.


1072
00:38:13,419 --> 00:38:13,879
All right.


1073
00:38:14,939 --> 00:38:15,259
Hey.


1074
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:17,399
Hey, I got my hands up anyway, so...


1075
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,259
Huh, hey, stay here. Hey, stay.


1076
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:22,559
Hey, you're not free to leave. Get out of the
car now.


1077
00:38:22,619 --> 00:38:22,979
Why?


1078
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:24,099
Get out of the car.


1079
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:24,519
I got my hands up.


1080
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,939
Get out of the car.


1081
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,919
All right.


1082
00:38:28,979 --> 00:38:29,559
Stay right there.


1083
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,560
Like I said... No, you're on camera.


1084
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,839
Okay. Okay, cool.


1085
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:32,900
Hands are up.


1086
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,699
I'm not gonna do anything.


1087
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,739
All right. Like I said I came here for my
rent money.


1088
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:35,939
I see it. Okay.


1089
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,819
Her mom attacked me and so did her mom's
boyfriend.


1090
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:39,920
Okay. All right. Well, I'm trying to figure
out the whole situation, okay?


1091
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:40,799
And the rent is out there and everybody
around here.


1092
00:38:40,799 --> 00:38:42,759
We are in a legal document together.


1093
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:45,659
Okay. Hey, so stay out of the car. Stay out
of the car.


1094
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:48,279
She took all but three thousand dollars.
Okay?


1095
00:38:48,279 --> 00:38:48,999
Can I have my phone?


1096
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,099
That's fine.


1097
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:50,779
Stay right there.


1098
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:51,839
So I can't grab my phone?


1099
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:52,399
No.


1100
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:52,739
Why?


1101
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:54,299
'Cause I don't know what's in the view right
now.


1102
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:54,859
Why? I have to be in this angle?


1103
00:38:54,859 --> 00:38:58,399
All right, I'm waiting for my back. I'm the
only one here. All right, true.


1104
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,659
[sirens wailing]


1105
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:03,759
So you know what's crazy? Is when it's...
[laughs] Y'all stay doing this. Let's do


1106
00:39:03,759 --> 00:39:04,739
this. Let's do this. Who had the gun?


1107
00:39:04,939 --> 00:39:06,079
The person inside the house!


1108
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:06,499
Some people in here.


1109
00:39:06,759 --> 00:39:07,759
A male or female?


1110
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,459
A male. A male.


1111
00:39:08,739 --> 00:39:09,179
Okay.


1112
00:39:10,699 --> 00:39:10,939
All right.


1113
00:39:10,939 --> 00:39:12,499
We want to know. We want to know what
happened.


1114
00:39:12,499 --> 00:39:13,039
Stay here, okay?


1115
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:14,239
We're here.


1116
00:39:14,299 --> 00:39:17,759
We're here. Why are we sitting here and we're
in a wig? We've never seen the gun.


1117
00:39:17,899 --> 00:39:18,479
He had the gun. He had the gun.


1118
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,319
Okay, you said a male? Black or- is he black
or white?


1119
00:39:21,339 --> 00:39:21,959
He's always dressed.


1120
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,039
Black with dreads.


1121
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:23,059
With dreads.


1122
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:23,479
Okay.


1123
00:39:24,679 --> 00:39:25,699
Who is that? Who just said he saw somebody?


1124
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:26,859
So a car with a dog?


1125
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:27,539
We saw a car.


1126
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:29,919
All right, this ain't a point. We're trying
to figure out the situation. With the Buick?


1127
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:31,479
Yeah, he's sitting down from here.


1128
00:39:31,479 --> 00:39:34,819
Hey, the dog. [camcorder clicking] The
vehicle with the dog.


1129
00:39:36,759 --> 00:39:40,179
It's my grandma. You're low. You're low.


1130
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:41,219
What car? What car?


1131
00:39:42,259 --> 00:39:43,519
I don't know.


1132
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,799
The guy with the dr- black hair and dreads.
Same car. That's it.


1133
00:39:46,799 --> 00:39:48,839
They came up with red hat and shit. They
can't- they can't-


1134
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:49,039
All right. Okay.


1135
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:51,819
... get to my mom's house. Until my daughter
and her mom are out.


1136
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,939
Okay, can we just separate for now? We're
trying to figure out another situation right


1137
00:39:55,219 --> 00:39:55,759
now, okay? This is what fat


1138
00:39:56,059 --> 00:39:56,939
Here too, you fat bitch.


1139
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:56,959
Who is that?


1140
00:39:58,819 --> 00:39:59,579
My grandmother.


1141
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,559
Is she inside?


1142
00:40:00,759 --> 00:40:00,919
Yeah.


1143
00:40:01,159 --> 00:40:02,659
Where's this- where's this dude with the gun?


1144
00:40:02,739 --> 00:40:02,939
I don't know.


1145
00:40:02,939 --> 00:40:05,139
There is nobody with a [censored] gun.
They're done.


1146
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:07,619
All right, so can y'all just move over here,
please?


1147
00:40:07,659 --> 00:40:09,599
No, my house is there, I'd rather stay there.


1148
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:10,199
Wait,


1149
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:11,579
you stay up here.


1150
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:12,859
No, my mom's... All right.


1151
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:13,839
Okay, where are they?


1152
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:14,519
She's gonna watch her.


1153
00:40:14,959 --> 00:40:18,099
No, this little bitch called my grandma,
beats with my daughter.


1154
00:40:18,099 --> 00:40:18,719
Can you go up to the door?


1155
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:19,419
They jumped on my mom.


1156
00:40:20,799 --> 00:40:21,079
No.


1157
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:22,639
Okay, are you guys involved?


1158
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:23,819
Huh?


1159
00:40:23,899 --> 00:40:24,879
Are you guys involved?


1160
00:40:25,019 --> 00:40:25,199
No.


1161
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:26,799
Who called?


1162
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:27,819
I didn't call.


1163
00:40:27,899 --> 00:40:28,579
I don't know who called.


1164
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:29,159
Who called?


1165
00:40:29,159 --> 00:40:29,179
Are you getting-


1166
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,959
Probably the person that tried to pull out
the gun.


1167
00:40:31,279 --> 00:40:32,099
Where is that person?


1168
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:32,799
In the house.


1169
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:33,099
She's been there!


1170
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:35,559
In the house. Are the people associated in
the house?


1171
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:36,039
Yes.


1172
00:40:36,139 --> 00:40:36,379
Yes.


1173
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:37,699
Is anyone injured in the house?


1174
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:38,059
I don't know.


1175
00:40:38,059 --> 00:40:38,299
I don't know.


1176
00:40:38,919 --> 00:40:41,139
Okay. Were any of you guys threatened
specifically?


1177
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:45,499
She came out. She came out. I... See, okay,
let me talk.


1178
00:40:45,559 --> 00:40:49,759
So when we first came, I just wanted my rent
money because we were on a lease together.


1179
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:50,639
A legal-


1180
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:50,999
We saw them


1181
00:40:50,999 --> 00:40:53,999
A legal bonding lease. We were on a legal
bonding lease.


1182
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,159
Her name was on the lease, and I came here to
see if she was-


1183
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,419
Okay, the person in the gun is inside, okay?


1184
00:40:57,419 --> 00:40:57,659
Yes.


1185
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,779
Did they threaten you with it?


1186
00:40:58,879 --> 00:40:59,059
Yes!


1187
00:40:59,059 --> 00:40:59,999
Yes! He literally pulled his gun out.


1188
00:41:00,119 --> 00:41:01,879
He kept- he kept holding it like this.


1189
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:02,239
In which-


1190
00:41:02,239 --> 00:41:05,339
And so, like I was saying, when we came here-


1191
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:06,819
Hey, don't- don't do nothing. Don't be
stupid.


1192
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:07,419
When we came here-


1193
00:41:07,899 --> 00:41:10,479
Oh, you need to tell me how sick your
grandmother is.


1194
00:41:10,659 --> 00:41:10,999
So one-


1195
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:12,139
So they can get medical attention.


1196
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,999
Two, I don't know whatever car, they came,
pulled up- [censored] in my door.


1197
00:41:16,999 --> 00:41:17,959
[dog barking]


1198
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:17,999
Hey. Hey. Hey.


1199
00:41:17,999 --> 00:41:18,639
That bitch.


1200
00:41:18,699 --> 00:41:19,699
Hey. Hey.


1201
00:41:19,699 --> 00:41:20,019
Where's the


1202
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:20,879
Go get her.


1203
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:21,919
No.


1204
00:41:21,919 --> 00:41:23,799
Please. Come on outside right now, please.


1205
00:41:23,799 --> 00:41:24,379
Are you hurt?


1206
00:41:25,479 --> 00:41:25,499
What?


1207
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:26,079
Are you hurt?


1208
00:41:26,279 --> 00:41:26,519
Um..


1209
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:27,479
Come outside.


1210
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:28,499
Come outside. Let's-


1211
00:41:28,499 --> 00:41:28,619
Come out.


1212
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,699
Let's come outside so we can have a talk.


1213
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:30,579
Come outside.


1214
00:41:30,659 --> 00:41:31,279
Come outside.


1215
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,699
We're not having a discussion about this
right now. That's for the resident.


1216
00:41:34,519 --> 00:41:37,259
I want to make sure you get some aid, okay?
So I want you to answer for this.


1217
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:37,719
No.


1218
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:39,579
You don't get away from that-


1219
00:41:39,979 --> 00:41:40,739
Back up, please.


1220
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:41,099
Come on.


1221
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:41,879
This is my mom.


1222
00:41:42,059 --> 00:41:46,899
I understand. But can you get her help? Let's
get her help. Can we move? Could someone take


1223
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:50,559
her? Come on. Can you grab her? Okay. We're
going to give you some help, okay? You want


1224
00:41:52,039 --> 00:41:55,379
to give you some help, okay? You want to go
out the back or... Where are you taking her?


1225
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:59,699
I'm just getting her away from the scene.
I'll take her down here. No, nope, they're


1226
00:41:59,699 --> 00:42:01,919
right there. You can take her right there.
Nope. Okay, well...


1227
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:06,819
The cops tried to understand the situation as
both parties had different statements.


1228
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:11,619
However, the old grandma, whom the teens
attacked, set the record straight and told


1229
00:42:11,659 --> 00:42:12,739
the old grandma, whom the teens attacked, set
the record straight and told the cops what


1230
00:42:12,819 --> 00:42:16,499
actually happened. In the living room, and
she's like, "Grandma," she goes, "There's a


1231
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:20,499
bunch of people outside." Because she,
[laughs] she's a roommate to one of the


1232
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:24,919
girls. And then I, I came out and there's a
girl starting to hit on me.


1233
00:42:25,399 --> 00:42:29,759
And she bit my finger. So the girl in the
black tank top? Black tank?


1234
00:42:30,019 --> 00:42:34,439
And a red bra underneath. Her hair is messy
and she's got black shorts on.


1235
00:42:34,459 --> 00:42:35,899
She came in the fucking house.


1236
00:42:35,899 --> 00:42:36,779
This is your house?


1237
00:42:36,779 --> 00:42:37,679
Yeah, yeah. Came in the f-


1238
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:41,219
One... Both of you! Oh, you ****** that
night, you miserable ass bitch!


1239
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:45,739
Meanwhile, another officer was investigating
the teens involved in the incident.


1240
00:42:45,879 --> 00:42:47,339
I need to figure out what happened today, so
I can act.


1241
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:50,139
Okay, well, today we came here just to ask-


1242
00:42:50,429 --> 00:42:51,650
... for the money back.


1243
00:42:51,709 --> 00:42:51,849
Okay.


1244
00:42:51,849 --> 00:42:56,449
And instead of saying, "Hey, can we talk
about this?", her mom immediately came outta


1245
00:42:56,489 --> 00:42:57,089
the car and hit me. Okay. Who-


1246
00:42:57,389 --> 00:42:57,409
Mom.


1247
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,169
What does she look like?


1248
00:42:58,169 --> 00:42:58,630
The one I was just hitting. She's not coming
out.


1249
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,949
The mom is the, the mom is the bigger one
with the-


1250
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:01,889
Wait, wait, time out, time out.


1251
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:02,789
They look alike.


1252
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:03,089
Okay.


1253
00:43:03,569 --> 00:43:03,589
Her name-


1254
00:43:03,589 --> 00:43:05,410
She's 16, do we know what she was wearing at
all?


1255
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:06,649
Her name is... I don't know her name.


1256
00:43:07,949 --> 00:43:11,629
Okay. So would you be willing to be a victim
and press charges?


1257
00:43:11,629 --> 00:43:13,749
Yeah. I want, I want to sue her. She's on my
lease.


1258
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:14,029
Okay.


1259
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:14,249
I-


1260
00:43:14,249 --> 00:43:15,889
Is she a family member of yours at all?
What's that relationship?


1261
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,269
I thought she was. But no, she's not.


1262
00:43:17,449 --> 00:43:18,070
No blood relation?


1263
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:18,810
She's not blood related at all. No.


1264
00:43:18,810 --> 00:43:19,750
Okay, got you.


1265
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:22,750
At this point, at this point I want to press
charges.


1266
00:43:23,150 --> 00:43:25,609
In that car is one of them, the white car.


1267
00:43:25,609 --> 00:43:26,229
The white car?


1268
00:43:26,269 --> 00:43:26,729
Yes.


1269
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:26,929
Okay.


1270
00:43:26,969 --> 00:43:30,090
And then, uh, white guy come in with the
Black girl.


1271
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:34,629
He goes, "Come on, Rebecca, you, you deserve
this." And I told him to get out.


1272
00:43:34,629 --> 00:43:37,249
I said, "I have a grandson here." And


1273
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,209
he just kept pushing his way in too.


1274
00:43:40,289 --> 00:43:41,969
Okay. Were there any weapons?


1275
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:46,589
I, I didn't see any. I, I really c- tell you,
I just know what was going on, on my


1276
00:43:46,629 --> 00:43:47,609
porch. [sobs]


1277
00:43:48,909 --> 00:43:53,669
And my line, I mean, the lady upstairs came
down and was talking to them and I don't know


1278
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:56,209
what they said to her. [sobs]


1279
00:43:57,529 --> 00:44:01,629
Uh, my grandson is five years old but he's,
he's gonna be home soon.


1280
00:44:01,629 --> 00:44:03,729
He's in daycare. [sobs]


1281
00:44:03,729 --> 00:44:08,309
Okay. We'll just keep you here, okay? So you
said black bra? Or sorry, red bra?


1282
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:10,989
B- b- black tank top, a, a red bra,


1283
00:44:11,669 --> 00:44:13,349
um, and black shorts.


1284
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,649
And she's tall, she's about 5'8".


1285
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:19,729
[sobs]


1286
00:44:19,729 --> 00:44:22,209
And she was... You... They were all fighting
outside?


1287
00:44:23,309 --> 00:44:25,389
No, when my daug... 'Cause I called my
daughter.


1288
00:44:25,749 --> 00:44:30,209
And my daughter come pulling in and the girl
jumped out of some car and it, a-


1289
00:44:30,469 --> 00:44:31,989
attacked my daughter on the porch.


1290
00:44:32,829 --> 00:44:35,749
That's when I opened the door because I heard
banging.


1291
00:44:36,089 --> 00:44:37,549
And then the Black girl, uh,


1292
00:44:38,749 --> 00:44:42,809
pushed my gr... my daughter in the house. And
then started punching her.


1293
00:44:42,809 --> 00:44:47,549
And it, my grand... my granddaughter came
out, that's her mom, and s- she started


1294
00:44:47,569 --> 00:44:52,489
punching on her. And we were trying to get
her out and I was trying to get in there to


1295
00:44:52,509 --> 00:44:57,009
call the police. And then that, that girl
started punching on me, on my head and


1296
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,289
everything. [sobs]


1297
00:44:58,289 --> 00:44:58,609
Okay.


1298
00:45:00,329 --> 00:45:04,509
Yeah. I don't, I don't feel well. I, I just
was in the emergency room.


1299
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:07,529
My, my liver, I, I got problem with my liver,
I...


1300
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,529
Like I said, I would like to press legal
charges.


1301
00:45:11,689 --> 00:45:12,009
Absolutely.


1302
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:14,869
Because again, we have a lease together.


1303
00:45:14,909 --> 00:45:14,969
Absolutely.


1304
00:45:14,969 --> 00:45:15,909
She knows where I live now.


1305
00:45:15,909 --> 00:45:16,289
Okay, well, let me get your name.


1306
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:21,149
And now that her friends have pulled a gun
out on me, I'm scared for my safety. I am a


1307
00:45:21,169 --> 00:45:23,289
nurse. I have a lot more to lose to do this.


1308
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:23,909
Can you tell us the name of the place and the
people over here?


1309
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:24,829
Do you get what I'm saying?


1310
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:29,269
Do you get what I'm saying? Like, I have a
lot more to lose than to engage in violent


1311
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:33,329
activity. You said your name is? How does she
still have that money? Does she like live...


1312
00:45:33,429 --> 00:45:34,309
Like, how does that go down? Um, she's
staying with her. They're on the same lease.


1313
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:35,709
Oh, okay. So they took her money?


1314
00:45:35,829 --> 00:45:38,929
She took her money, yeah. She said she
wouldn't be able so we came here.


1315
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:42,569
The mom and the boyfriend pulled up in the
car. The mom jumped out and started swinging


1316
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,929
on her. So she whooped her ass. She whooped
her ass. The grandma got her ass whooping.


1317
00:45:45,929 --> 00:45:47,089
The grandma started hitting me.


1318
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:47,869
She's 16.


1319
00:45:48,089 --> 00:45:51,389
They started hitting me too. And then I
started to defend myself.


1320
00:45:51,409 --> 00:45:56,069
They dragged me in the house. [crosstalk]
Exactly. She started hitting us with the pan.


1321
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:59,149
Then the man hit her. And then she's like,
"Let that lady go."


1322
00:45:59,149 --> 00:45:59,949
Is the man with the...


1323
00:46:00,149 --> 00:46:04,149
With the gun. The man with the gun. He p- he
hit her. And then he pulled the gun out.


1324
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,869
Mama, I need to talk to you separate real
quick.


1325
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:08,789
The grandma got her ass whooped. God dammit!
Everybody who... Nobody's replying.


1326
00:46:08,789 --> 00:46:11,869
And like I said, we are on a legal binding
document together.


1327
00:46:11,889 --> 00:46:15,729
Repay rent, she has not been in my home since
July 11th.


1328
00:46:15,729 --> 00:46:16,589
Okay, can I have you get back, officer?


1329
00:46:16,909 --> 00:46:17,249
Can you


1330
00:46:18,029 --> 00:46:20,309
turn around but chain my back for right now,
okay?


1331
00:46:20,329 --> 00:46:20,349
What?


1332
00:46:20,349 --> 00:46:21,189
You're just being detained.


1333
00:46:21,509 --> 00:46:21,789
Why?


1334
00:46:21,789 --> 00:46:22,609
Put your handcuffs on, bro.


1335
00:46:22,629 --> 00:46:23,909
Why am I being detained?


1336
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:25,409
Because you is...


1337
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,949
You're a suspect in all this. Okay?


1338
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:29,069
No.


1339
00:46:29,069 --> 00:46:32,529
I don't know exactly how but we'll figure it
out, okay? So you're not under arrest.


1340
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:33,009
All right, have fun.


1341
00:46:33,009 --> 00:46:33,649
You're just being detained.


1342
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,529
Get in there, buddy, please. Do you have any
weapons?


1343
00:46:36,549 --> 00:46:38,429
Oh my god, no. I'm a nurse.


1344
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:39,509
No. Wait, what?


1345
00:46:39,509 --> 00:46:41,089
I have a nur... I'm a nurse.


1346
00:46:41,869 --> 00:46:41,889
Are you sure?


1347
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:45,949
I'm a nurse. I just got through working at
Harborview. Like I said, I have a lot more to


1348
00:46:45,949 --> 00:46:46,089
lose. We don't have time for that.


1349
00:46:46,089 --> 00:46:48,409
They have all ill intent in that house.


1350
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:53,529
Unfortunately, being nurse doesn't permit you
to break the law and defend it later on.


1351
00:46:53,649 --> 00:46:56,889
They have ill intent. They were planning on
sh- they obviously s-


1352
00:46:56,889 --> 00:46:59,389
Okay, right now you're actually detained,
okay? You're good to go.


1353
00:46:59,449 --> 00:46:59,589
Wait, what?


1354
00:46:59,589 --> 00:47:00,709
We're gonna investigate this investigation.


1355
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:01,649
What? Wait.


1356
00:47:01,649 --> 00:47:01,809
You guys go.


1357
00:47:01,829 --> 00:47:04,749
Just chill out. Chill out, it's okay. Chill
out. I know.


1358
00:47:04,749 --> 00:47:06,169
You're just detained right now, okay?


1359
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:06,589
I did not.


1360
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:07,869
You did. Chill out.


1361
00:47:08,769 --> 00:47:12,649
What? [laughs] What? [gasps] Are you serious?


1362
00:47:14,089 --> 00:47:16,789
I'm a whole nurse. Are you serious?


1363
00:47:17,129 --> 00:47:18,729
46F, detain.


1364
00:47:19,029 --> 00:47:22,589
What? Oh my god. I've never even been
detained.


1365
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:23,549
Okay, hey, bud.


1366
00:47:23,849 --> 00:47:24,969
You can't touch me like that.


1367
00:47:25,629 --> 00:47:26,749
Don't grab my phone like that.


1368
00:47:27,589 --> 00:47:28,529
Step away or we're gonna get our shot.


1369
00:47:28,769 --> 00:47:30,889
I'm backing up but you can't... But I'm here
with them.


1370
00:47:31,229 --> 00:47:31,909
What do you mean?


1371
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:33,749
With everyone here, what do you mean, bro?


1372
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:34,929
You're either gonna go out there and stand
outside-


1373
00:47:34,929 --> 00:47:36,969
Bro, I was sitting there at a reasonable
area.


1374
00:47:37,069 --> 00:47:37,089
Bro.


1375
00:47:37,089 --> 00:47:37,849
Why are you grabbing me?


1376
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:38,549
Because this is an area.


1377
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:40,229
Where's your hand... Bro, what is your badge
number, bro?


1378
00:47:40,229 --> 00:47:41,589
It's right there. We're gonna end up
arresting you.


1379
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:42,449
I'm serious, bro.


1380
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:43,449
We're gonna end up arresting you.


1381
00:47:43,449 --> 00:47:44,609
No. Why are you arresting me?


1382
00:47:44,789 --> 00:47:46,029
We're gonna end up. Why?


1383
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:47,929
Why the fuck don't you understand? Well, how
are you gonna arrest me?


1384
00:47:48,069 --> 00:47:48,329
Step away from the scene.


1385
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:49,369
What am I doing wrong?


1386
00:47:49,389 --> 00:47:51,069
I'm walking away. We're trying to do a DSA
here.


1387
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,429
Bro, my ride is over here so why are you
pushing me this side?


1388
00:47:53,429 --> 00:47:54,969
Then leave. You have the option to leave or
stay.


1389
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:59,709
This guy was accompanying the teens,
defending them, and filming the whole scene.


1390
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:03,689
He even tried to threaten cops until they
decided to teach him a lesson.


1391
00:48:03,749 --> 00:48:04,809
Outside the area.


1392
00:48:05,069 --> 00:48:08,829
I'm literally fucking... This is all public
area. You cannot push me anywhere.


1393
00:48:08,929 --> 00:48:09,189
It's a police location. It's a police
location.


1394
00:48:09,229 --> 00:48:10,149
You can though.


1395
00:48:11,149 --> 00:48:12,909
Why are you guys really doing the most right
now?


1396
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:14,349
Because this is an investigation.


1397
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,169
You can't touch me or nothing.


1398
00:48:15,349 --> 00:48:16,109
We can touch you.


1399
00:48:16,209 --> 00:48:16,489
Why?


1400
00:48:16,489 --> 00:48:17,209
What did I just tell you?


1401
00:48:17,209 --> 00:48:17,469
Why?


1402
00:48:17,469 --> 00:48:18,449
Step away or you're gonna get arrested.


1403
00:48:18,449 --> 00:48:19,409
I'm not doing nothing wrong.


1404
00:48:19,509 --> 00:48:19,529
Then step away.


1405
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:21,929
I'm from a reasonable distance and you're
attacking me right now.


1406
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:23,589
Look, look, you got two-


1407
00:48:23,589 --> 00:48:24,669
Now you're coming up with shit right now.


1408
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:28,669
No, no, look, look, you talk to me. Only you.
Hey, we're following, like, we speak the same


1409
00:48:28,749 --> 00:48:28,949
language, right? Right.


1410
00:48:28,949 --> 00:48:30,009
You have two options, okay?


1411
00:48:30,629 --> 00:48:35,149
Chill out over here, away from the scene.
Okay? Or else we are, we're gonna arrest you


1412
00:48:35,149 --> 00:48:35,989
for obstruction. How am I obstructing this?


1413
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:36,849
I'm speaking your angle, bro.


1414
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:38,549
But how am I obstructing the scene? Can I ask
that?


1415
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,009
Okay. Because you're just being too close.
This is a crime scene.


1416
00:48:40,049 --> 00:48:42,469
How? I was literally at least 20 yards away.


1417
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:43,869
Look, I'm telling that to you respectfully.
Look.


1418
00:48:43,869 --> 00:48:45,749
At least. From an officer with any type of
weapon.


1419
00:48:45,749 --> 00:48:45,789
We're recording. We have more cameras in
there than that.


1420
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:47,069
And you guys keep walking up to me.


1421
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:49,789
Hey, but now, but now, we just need you to,
uh, just step away from her.


1422
00:48:49,789 --> 00:48:52,189
Bro, I'm literally trying to make sure I'm
recording for her safety, bro.


1423
00:48:52,189 --> 00:48:52,589
'Cause you literally-


1424
00:48:52,589 --> 00:48:53,489
We are recording.


1425
00:48:53,509 --> 00:48:53,849
Bro.


1426
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:54,489
We are recording. We have more cameras in
here than that.


1427
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,709
Bro, I want, I want your name and badge
number, bro.


1428
00:48:57,069 --> 00:48:58,389
Hey, bro, hey.


1429
00:49:00,219 --> 00:49:03,599
I didn't even do nothing wrong, bro.


1430
00:49:03,919 --> 00:49:04,739
Just relax.


1431
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:06,299
I didn't do nothing wrong, bro.


1432
00:49:06,539 --> 00:49:07,499
You refused to leave-


1433
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:08,140
I didn't refuse to leave


1434
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,439
... several verbal commands.


1435
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:09,580
I didn't though.


1436
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,300
Lawful commands.


1437
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,699
I drove off a public school bus.


1438
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:14,260
All right, bro. All right. Well now you're
gonna get arrested and booked.


1439
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:14,660
I am though. None of this is fighting.


1440
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,639
Ma'am, do you remember who hit you today?


1441
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:17,200
Yeah.


1442
00:49:17,279 --> 00:49:18,520
You, you would remember them if you saw-


1443
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,039
I don't know her name but I, I'll recognize
her.


1444
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,760
Okay, but, but you'd be able to recognize
her?


1445
00:49:20,859 --> 00:49:20,879
Yeah. Yeah.


1446
00:49:20,879 --> 00:49:24,639
Okay. So right now we have somebody detained
in handcuffs, okay?


1447
00:49:24,639 --> 00:49:27,799
Just 'cause they're surrounded by police and
just 'cause they're in handcuffs doesn't mean


1448
00:49:27,819 --> 00:49:28,479
that is the person, okay?


1449
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:28,760
Okay.


1450
00:49:28,779 --> 00:49:32,100
It's just as important to know if it's not
the person as if it is, okay?


1451
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:32,279
Okay.


1452
00:49:32,279 --> 00:49:34,519
So what we're gonna do right now, we're gonna
put you in the back of this car.


1453
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:34,960
Okay.


1454
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,999
We're gonna have you, we're gonna drive by
that person.


1455
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:37,360
Okay.


1456
00:49:37,479 --> 00:49:39,940
I just need you to tell this officer, yes or
no, that is the person.


1457
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:40,279
Okay.


1458
00:49:40,279 --> 00:49:43,319
And then we're gonna take you down the road a
little bit so the fire department can check


1459
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:44,079
you down the road a little bit so the fire
department can check you out, okay? Okay. All


1460
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,019
right. All right, we'll help you out.


1461
00:49:45,139 --> 00:49:47,040
Okay. [coughs]


1462
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:48,359
Okay.


1463
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,719
I'll just explain it real quick, okay?


1464
00:49:49,759 --> 00:49:54,660
So I'll have you look out the window, and I
want you to just say yes or no if that's the


1465
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:54,959
person you recognize, okay?


1466
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:55,779
Look at the car?


1467
00:49:55,819 --> 00:49:56,319
Yeah. Look at the car.


1468
00:49:57,519 --> 00:49:57,999
That is


1469
00:49:58,839 --> 00:49:59,459
positive.


1470
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:02,379
One William 32, positive identification.


1471
00:50:02,939 --> 00:50:03,919
Let's get her out of here.


1472
00:50:04,179 --> 00:50:06,379
Hold on, can you say what's going on?


1473
00:50:06,379 --> 00:50:07,599
Arrest for assault.


1474
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,179
For what? They touched me first.


1475
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,779
Here, let's go.


1476
00:50:10,359 --> 00:50:10,799
Come on.


1477
00:50:10,939 --> 00:50:12,439
That makes no sense. You guys are just
grasping at my son.


1478
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:16,719
Hold on. Hold on, how was it assault if
someone touches you first?


1479
00:50:16,739 --> 00:50:17,099
So listen-


1480
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:21,059
I need a question. No, you guys keep trying
to tell me I just assaulted somebody.


1481
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:21,839
Look at me, look at me, look at me.


1482
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:22,959
How am I assaulting someone?


1483
00:50:22,959 --> 00:50:24,479
I would like to get your statement, okay?


1484
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:29,079
But you guys are arresting me. He just, he
didn't say that I was, he didn't say that I


1485
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:30,059
was getting arrested. He just said I was
detained.


1486
00:50:30,059 --> 00:50:31,099
Right now, I need you to chill out for me.


1487
00:50:31,099 --> 00:50:31,259
You guys just got-


1488
00:50:31,259 --> 00:50:33,759
Otherwise we're just gonna have to put you in
the car. You understand?


1489
00:50:33,979 --> 00:50:37,699
Bro, he got high line. Bro, this junk is...


1490
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:43,099
Bro, this... wanna touch me and everybody in
their family, and you guys wanna sit


1491
00:50:43,099 --> 00:50:47,899
here and arrest me? The f- I did not touch
nobody until they touched me. All three of


1492
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:51,379
them. All three of them touched me. The f-
and I'm supposed to sit there and just let...


1493
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:51,779
Bro,


1494
00:50:52,399 --> 00:50:57,139
that's crazy as... That's crazy as... So when
are you guys gonna get my statements?


1495
00:50:57,819 --> 00:50:58,319
I don't know.


1496
00:50:59,099 --> 00:50:59,759
What do you mean you don't know?


1497
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:01,819
Whose car, whose car is this? I'm not talking
to you. What's your name?


1498
00:51:01,919 --> 00:51:03,779
All right, I'm just gon- I'm gonna read you
your Miranda Rights, okay?


1499
00:51:03,799 --> 00:51:05,859
I want you to get my statement first.


1500
00:51:05,859 --> 00:51:07,139
You have the right to... Okay, I'm gonna read
you first.


1501
00:51:07,139 --> 00:51:07,479
No, I want you to-


1502
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:08,139
I gotta read you-


1503
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:09,439
I want you to get my statement first.


1504
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:11,839
Okay, listen, you can talk to me after this.
Let me read this to you first.


1505
00:51:12,059 --> 00:51:12,119
You just said-


1506
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:14,339
You have the right to remain silent. You have
the...


1507
00:51:14,619 --> 00:51:17,079
Anything you say can and will be used against
you in a court of law.


1508
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:21,199
You have the right to... You, you have the
right at this time to talk to a lawyer and


1509
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:24,619
have the right to... You, you have the right
at this time to talk to a lawyer and have him


1510
00:51:24,659 --> 00:51:25,919
present with you while you're being
questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a


1511
00:51:26,139 --> 00:51:26,679
lawyer, one will be appointed to represent
you before questioning if you wish. Hello,


1512
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:30,839
can I text my- You can decide at any time to
exercise these rights and not answer any


1513
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:31,319
questions or make any statements. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do that.


1514
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:32,859
Do you understand each of these rights I've
explained to you?


1515
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:34,659
Do you understand them?


1516
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,339
No.


1517
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:36,499
You don't?


1518
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:36,939
No.


1519
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:39,419
Having these rights in mind, do you wish to
talk to us now?


1520
00:51:40,199 --> 00:51:40,719
Yes.


1521
00:51:40,979 --> 00:51:42,739
But I need you to understand your rights
first.


1522
00:51:42,739 --> 00:51:43,619
Yes. I, sure. I understand.


1523
00:51:43,639 --> 00:51:44,519
You understand them? Okay.


1524
00:51:44,919 --> 00:51:48,019
So can I talk to you guys or you guys are
just gonna close the door and act like I


1525
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:50,839
didn't want- I'm, I have the door open. I'm
trying to make you talk. Give me your side of


1526
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:51,739
the door open. I'm trying to make you talk.
Give me your side of the story. Okay, so-


1527
00:51:52,099 --> 00:51:53,299
Oh, yeah. One second.


1528
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:56,039
Okay, but my question is why am I arrested?


1529
00:51:56,039 --> 00:51:58,659
Who, well, let me ask you, what, what, what's
the definition of assault?


1530
00:51:59,019 --> 00:52:03,859
The teen started trying to puzzle the cops,
asking them questions and pretending as if


1531
00:52:03,919 --> 00:52:04,879
she was the victim.


1532
00:52:04,959 --> 00:52:06,719
So I would... Excuse me, Mr. Lee.


1533
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:07,279
Yeah, what's up?


1534
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:10,099
I just have a quick question, what is the
definition of assault?


1535
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:12,779
What is the definition of assault? Any
unwanted touching.


1536
00:52:13,039 --> 00:52:13,439
Okay.


1537
00:52:14,359 --> 00:52:15,899
Is that the full definition?


1538
00:52:16,159 --> 00:52:17,179
No, but that's part of it.


1539
00:52:17,419 --> 00:52:17,819
But I want-


1540
00:52:17,979 --> 00:52:18,939
What, what happened to your-


1541
00:52:19,179 --> 00:52:24,039
Can I, can I an- can I talk to you 'cause
they keep saying I w- he literally just said


1542
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:25,559
I an- can I talk to you 'cause they keep
saying I w- he literally just said I was able


1543
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:27,099
to you 'cause they keep saying I w- he
literally just said I was able to talk to


1544
00:52:27,299 --> 00:52:30,839
him, and he just walked away, so that's Okay,
did they read you your rights yet? The mother


1545
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:31,379
came out the car and started hitting me.
Okay.


1546
00:52:31,379 --> 00:52:32,919
Not once did I touch that lady.


1547
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:33,519
Who's, who's the-


1548
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:33,679
As-


1549
00:52:33,679 --> 00:52:34,279
Who's the mother?


1550
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,119
I don't know her name. I don't know her.


1551
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:40,159
The only person I know here is the one right
there that I can see through the trees.


1552
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:44,619
I don't know the mom, which is why when she
come- I thought the car said, "Who's this? Or


1553
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:49,699
who are these? What's the problem?" I, she,
she came up to me, hit, tried to hit us.


1554
00:52:49,779 --> 00:52:50,019
Stand by.


1555
00:52:50,019 --> 00:52:53,539
"What's your, who are you? Who are you? I'm
not touching nobody 'cause I don't even know


1556
00:52:53,739 --> 00:52:54,859
who are you? Who are you? I'm not touching
nobody 'cause I don't even know who you are.


1557
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:59,419
Who are you? I'm not touching nobody 'cause I
don't even know who you are. Who are you?


1558
00:52:59,419 --> 00:53:02,739
You're trying to get at me. You're trying to
hit me." Her man is trying to stop her,


1559
00:53:02,899 --> 00:53:03,799
talking, he's talking mess as well, but he's
also trying to stop her from hitting any of


1560
00:53:03,999 --> 00:53:05,399
us. So he's trying to stop her. Where, where
is he at? I don't know. He's the one that had


1561
00:53:05,479 --> 00:53:06,579
the one that had the gun. He's the one with
the gun? Okay.


1562
00:53:06,579 --> 00:53:09,399
Yeah, that's the same person that had the
gun. That was the only man here.


1563
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:09,819
Okay.


1564
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:14,179
[coughs] And so he's trying to stop the lady.
I'm like, "Who are you?" "I'm her mom.


1565
00:53:14,339 --> 00:53:18,399
I'm her mom. I'm her mom." Okay, that's
understandable, but where's your daughter?


1566
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,099
She's the one that said that she had the
money, she had the $3,000.


1567
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:23,319
Every person that-


1568
00:53:23,479 --> 00:53:23,499
So-


1569
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,099
Let me, let me explain to you, sir. We were
all calm.


1570
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:30,079
Her mother pulled up yelling, screaming,
saying she wants to fight and da, da, da, da,


1571
00:53:30,539 --> 00:53:33,939
da, da, da, da, da, da. Okay, who are you?
Like I said, we didn't know who her mother


1572
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:37,359
is. Renee just met her mother a couple years
ago. We don't know who that is.


1573
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:42,059
So when she comes up trying to fight us, I'm
not touching you, I don't know who you are.


1574
00:53:42,479 --> 00:53:45,719
Okay. She's, "La, la, la, that's my daughter,
that's my daughter." Okay, cool.


1575
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:50,339
She's, "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Open
the door. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.


1576
00:53:50,439 --> 00:53:53,999
Renee, come outside. Da, da, da, da, da, da.
Come outside." I don't even know what she was


1577
00:53:53,999 --> 00:53:57,699
saying, she was just yelling. "Come outside."
Then she pushes me. I tell her, "Do not touch


1578
00:53:58,139 --> 00:54:00,379
me. I tell her, "Do not touch me. Do not
touch me." She pushes me again.


1579
00:54:00,379 --> 00:54:03,979
"Do not touch me." Then she slaps me in my
face.


1580
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:09,399
That's when I touched her. As she slaps me in
my face, her grandmother opens the door and


1581
00:54:09,419 --> 00:54:11,059
the grandmother starts hitting me too.


1582
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:11,299
Mm-hmm.


1583
00:54:11,579 --> 00:54:15,599
So two people now are on me after I didn't
even touch the mom.


1584
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:16,659
I did not touch the mom


1585
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:19,219
outside yet. The grandma didn't open the
door.


1586
00:54:19,279 --> 00:54:19,459
Mm-hmm.


1587
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:22,399
So how am I getting arrested for assault?


1588
00:54:22,479 --> 00:54:22,919
61.


1589
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:24,459
How am I getting arrested for assault?


1590
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:28,879
Like, we all came here just to talk. I just
wanted to talk to her. I've been best friends


1591
00:54:28,879 --> 00:54:29,759
with her for 11 years. Did you, did you fight
back at all?


1592
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:30,339
No.


1593
00:54:30,339 --> 00:54:31,119
To any degree?


1594
00:54:31,479 --> 00:54:32,579
No, I got hit.


1595
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:33,139
Okay.


1596
00:54:33,439 --> 00:54:37,179
I got hit. How could I fight back to a man? I
got hit by a man.


1597
00:54:37,699 --> 00:54:37,919
So


1598
00:54:38,999 --> 00:54:43,819
she's going to PC for questioning, okay? It's
DV because they're former roommates.


1599
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:47,419
So let's get her out of here and let's
question her someplace else that's not right


1600
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:48,079
here. Okay.


1601
00:54:48,179 --> 00:54:48,579
Perfect?


1602
00:54:48,779 --> 00:54:50,179
Okay, so, uh, she's under arrest at this
point?


1603
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:52,319
She's under arrest at this point for assault
four.


1604
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:52,759
Okay.


1605
00:54:52,779 --> 00:54:55,079
At this point. We gotta figure out if there's
more to it.


1606
00:54:55,079 --> 00:54:55,419
I think we need to take a video.


1607
00:54:55,419 --> 00:54:56,419
Okay.


1608
00:54:56,519 --> 00:54:57,519
But I definitely wanna finish up with her
statement, I just don't wanna do it here.


1609
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:59,119
There's too many, there's too many moving
parts here.


1610
00:54:59,279 --> 00:55:02,199
Okay. Can you just go ahead and stand up? So
just tell them you're under arrest, okay?


1611
00:55:02,439 --> 00:55:03,379
I'm under arrest?


1612
00:55:03,379 --> 00:55:04,119
Yes. So we're gonna walk out-


1613
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:05,759
This is horrible. How am I under arrest?


1614
00:55:05,759 --> 00:55:08,379
We'll explain it there. Please do not start
fighting us, okay?


1615
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:09,759
This is horrible.


1616
00:55:11,189 --> 00:55:12,609
Let's go and, we're gonna go in the back
seat, okay?


1617
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:15,109
I have so much to lose.


1618
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:15,509
Hey,


1619
00:55:16,309 --> 00:55:18,110
just because you're under arrest doesn't mean
you're convicted of a crime.


1620
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:19,869
Okay, this is horrible. I've never been
arrested.


1621
00:55:20,829 --> 00:55:20,850
Okay. [door closing]


1622
00:55:20,850 --> 00:55:22,130
I've never been arrested.


1623
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:22,489
Okay.


1624
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:23,530
I'm literally like-


1625
00:55:23,530 --> 00:55:24,690
Do you have, do you have anything on your
person, you're under arrest?


1626
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:25,649
No, I don't.


1627
00:55:25,649 --> 00:55:27,349
Okay, just wanna search your person. You're
under arrest.


1628
00:55:27,349 --> 00:55:29,269
No, I don't have anything on me.


1629
00:55:30,829 --> 00:55:31,909
I don't have anything on me.


1630
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:34,869
We have to search. It's a, it's policy that
we search this, sir.


1631
00:55:36,369 --> 00:55:39,709
I didn't come in here with ill intent. I just
wanted to talk.


1632
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:40,909
All right, go ahead and face the car.


1633
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:42,929
I just wanted to talk.


1634
00:55:43,449 --> 00:55:43,490
Face the car. Face the car.


1635
00:55:43,490 --> 00:55:43,650
[cries]


1636
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:46,990
All right, understand it's frustrating. Go
ahead and kick one of your legs out for me.


1637
00:55:47,389 --> 00:55:48,190
While there's a chance.


1638
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,529
No! [cries]


1639
00:55:51,529 --> 00:55:52,590
All right, go and have seat.


1640
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,350
I'll put the window down, I'll do everything
I can to make you feel-


1641
00:55:55,350 --> 00:55:57,169
I'm very claustrophobic. I'm very-


1642
00:55:57,169 --> 00:55:57,409
... I am so sorry.


1643
00:55:57,409 --> 00:55:58,150
And I have asthma.


1644
00:55:58,150 --> 00:55:58,549
There is no point in being afraid of me.


1645
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:00,789
Seriously, I'm not making this up. Like-


1646
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:01,430
Okay,


1647
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,729
we will do everything we can to make you
comfy but we-


1648
00:56:03,729 --> 00:56:06,289
I've never been arrested ever a day in my
life.


1649
00:56:06,449 --> 00:56:06,849
It will help-


1650
00:56:06,909 --> 00:56:07,469
This is not fair.


1651
00:56:07,529 --> 00:56:09,049
It will help if you just take a breath.


1652
00:56:09,849 --> 00:56:14,129
I... Oh, my God. Wait, why isn't the person
that hit me arrested?


1653
00:56:14,149 --> 00:56:15,549
The w- the grown woman?


1654
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:17,689
She might be, I don't know. I'm only being
with you.


1655
00:56:17,689 --> 00:56:21,049
She's not. I'm looking at... She's not in
handcuffs and she's the one that attacked me.


1656
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:22,269
Okay. Well, let me ask you something-


1657
00:56:22,269 --> 00:56:26,529
So the grandma's not getting arre- they all
touched me first. I'm genuinely confused.


1658
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:28,489
I mean, I don't know. Do you live here or
not?


1659
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:30,069
Why... No, why would I live here?


1660
00:56:30,069 --> 00:56:31,009
So how'd you get inside?


1661
00:56:31,189 --> 00:56:34,349
I didn't... They pulled me. I'm t- I'm not
even trying to be, um, rude.


1662
00:56:34,349 --> 00:56:35,369
All right, can you stick your feet in?


1663
00:56:36,009 --> 00:56:36,089
Hold on, I'm like-


1664
00:56:36,089 --> 00:56:36,749
I'm gonna buckle you up.


1665
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:38,549
Bro, that's... I'm... You guys, I just...


1666
00:56:38,549 --> 00:56:42,849
And what's crazy is you guys keep telling me
I'm gonna be able to talk and you're not


1667
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:43,849
letting me talk. We're gonna talk at the
station.


1668
00:56:43,849 --> 00:56:44,189
That's what's crazy.


1669
00:56:44,369 --> 00:56:45,929
We're moving you to the station, yeah.


1670
00:56:46,889 --> 00:56:48,489
But why... Bro, [sighs] this makes no sense.


1671
00:56:48,489 --> 00:56:49,629
Can you put your feet in, please?


1672
00:56:49,869 --> 00:56:52,349
This makes no sense though. Like, it makes no
sense-


1673
00:56:52,349 --> 00:56:53,189
Can you put your feet in?


1674
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:55,509
... but it makes no sense. You guys are-


1675
00:56:55,509 --> 00:56:56,709
You're gonna be able to talk to me at the
station.


1676
00:56:56,709 --> 00:57:01,129
So why did you just... Why did you just get
my whole, uh, name, all that,


1677
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:01,709
birthday?


1678
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:02,069
Well, I still have it.


1679
00:57:02,189 --> 00:57:02,269
But I-


1680
00:57:02,269 --> 00:57:02,889
I still need it.


1681
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,029
I understand that.


1682
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:04,289
Okay.


1683
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,049
But you multiple times-


1684
00:57:05,049 --> 00:57:07,649
Well, I was told by my supervisor I'm gonna
interview down there, okay?


1685
00:57:07,789 --> 00:57:08,549
Okay, but you multi-


1686
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:09,209
Can you put your feet-


1687
00:57:09,209 --> 00:57:09,509
You yourself-


1688
00:57:09,589 --> 00:57:11,089
I, I know I did but that was before I was-


1689
00:57:11,149 --> 00:57:12,889
You're not even letting me talk. How is this
respect?


1690
00:57:13,169 --> 00:57:13,189
Okay, but-


1691
00:57:13,189 --> 00:57:14,129
You want me to respect you-


1692
00:57:14,169 --> 00:57:14,269
Okay, but-


1693
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,429
... but you're not letting me talk.


1694
00:57:15,429 --> 00:57:16,589
You don't have to respect me.


1695
00:57:17,929 --> 00:57:22,269
What? But you guy... Did you, did you guys
not say this would go smoothly if I respected


1696
00:57:22,269 --> 00:57:24,529
you? So you're saying that I could disrespect
you and it'd be cool?


1697
00:57:24,529 --> 00:57:26,849
You can go ahead if you want. I really don't
care, honestly.


1698
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:27,589
So you're saying I can disrespect you and
it'd be cool?


1699
00:57:27,589 --> 00:57:29,949
Can you put your feet in the damn car? Put
your feet in the car.


1700
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,109
No, don't talk to me like that.


1701
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:31,769
Put your feet in the car.


1702
00:57:31,769 --> 00:57:32,329
Don't talk to me like that.


1703
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:32,629
Could yo-


1704
00:57:33,269 --> 00:57:34,529
Don't talk to me like that.


1705
00:57:34,529 --> 00:57:34,989
Thank you.


1706
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:35,609
Don't talk to me like that.


1707
00:57:35,609 --> 00:57:37,309
If that makes it easier, we can move her this
way.


1708
00:57:38,829 --> 00:57:38,849
Thank you.


1709
00:57:38,849 --> 00:57:38,869
Not that car. They called 911.


1710
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:39,689
I told her to put her feet in.


1711
00:57:39,909 --> 00:57:39,929
You called 911?


1712
00:57:39,949 --> 00:57:41,109
Okay, but don't talk to me like that.


1713
00:57:41,109 --> 00:57:43,169
Okay. I've asked, I've asked you multiple
times-


1714
00:57:43,229 --> 00:57:45,469
Okay, don't talk to me like that and I just
told you-


1715
00:57:45,469 --> 00:57:45,529
Okay, can you please put your feet in?


1716
00:57:45,529 --> 00:57:47,549
And I just told you don't fucking be
disrespectful.


1717
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:47,769
Okay.


1718
00:57:48,189 --> 00:57:48,789
The hell?


1719
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:52,389
Can you just please... so I can buckle you
in, please?


1720
00:57:52,389 --> 00:57:52,949
Oh, this is...


1721
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,789
I need to make sure before I make a move-


1722
00:57:55,789 --> 00:57:56,269
[sirens]


1723
00:57:56,269 --> 00:57:58,029
Gosh, dang it, guys.


1724
00:57:58,589 --> 00:57:58,689
I


1725
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:00,649
might get it.


1726
00:58:00,649 --> 00:58:01,629
It's gonna say it's on tape.


1727
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:03,429
Perfect, perfect. Thank you.


1728
00:58:03,729 --> 00:58:04,749
The girl with the braids, what did she-


1729
00:58:05,029 --> 00:58:05,629
Y'all, how can people put their hands on me-


1730
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:06,549
She said this is DB Burr.


1731
00:58:06,549 --> 00:58:10,989
... and then me get arrested? And these...
are just... Yo, that's stupid as...


1732
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:16,209
On God, that's dumb as... I fuckin'... Bro,
you guys don't know how to do your job.


1733
00:58:16,309 --> 00:58:17,229
On God. That's


1734
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:18,749
Keep it together.


1735
00:58:18,749 --> 00:58:19,109
That's,


1736
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:20,189
that's,


1737
00:58:21,009 --> 00:58:21,249
that's-


1738
00:58:21,269 --> 00:58:22,409
You get it?


1739
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:25,329
That's... No, you don't get it! You don't!
You don't!


1740
00:58:25,329 --> 00:58:26,209
I don't want your foot to get hurt.


1741
00:58:26,209 --> 00:58:28,389
You don't! You don't get it! You don't!


1742
00:58:28,709 --> 00:58:33,089
The group faced charges of burglary, assault
and obstruction.


1743
00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:37,709
The girl in red was charged with domestic
violence for striking a roommate.


1744
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:42,489
Though these teen received their fate, the
next entitled girl can't even


1745
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:45,049
accept the consequences of her action.


1746
00:58:45,389 --> 00:58:45,809
Miss ma'am.


1747
00:58:45,809 --> 00:58:47,089
No, I just don't like it.


1748
00:58:47,089 --> 00:58:47,809
Miss, Miss Adriana.


1749
00:58:47,949 --> 00:58:49,249
I don't like it at all, bro.


1750
00:58:49,249 --> 00:58:49,709
That's good.


1751
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:54,609
On August 21st, 2024, officers responded to a
Target store


1752
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:59,629
following a report of two young ladies
shoplifting jewelry and other items.


1753
00:58:59,629 --> 00:59:02,029
[crying] I can't go to prison like these
people.


1754
00:59:02,029 --> 00:59:04,649
You're not going to prison. Jail. Prison's
different.


1755
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:07,069
These are the events that followed.


1756
00:59:07,849 --> 00:59:08,949
Hey, how you doing?


1757
00:59:10,169 --> 00:59:10,789
Hey, how's it going?


1758
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:11,289
How's it going?


1759
00:59:12,809 --> 00:59:15,429
Um, so these two young ladies here took


1760
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:18,129
everything that you see here.


1761
00:59:19,609 --> 00:59:21,169
Here you go. Let me grab that for you.


1762
00:59:24,789 --> 00:59:27,089
Here's the itemized receipt of what was
taken.


1763
00:59:27,749 --> 00:59:32,689
So essentially they came in, went to the
jewelry section, grabbed all that,


1764
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:36,889
put it inside of this bag that she was
carrying, in the white shirt.


1765
00:59:37,409 --> 00:59:37,689
Um-


1766
00:59:37,989 --> 00:59:38,549
Which bag?


1767
00:59:38,869 --> 00:59:39,509
This one here.


1768
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:39,529
This one?


1769
00:59:39,649 --> 00:59:40,969
The one that says the tote bag on it.


1770
00:59:42,429 --> 00:59:45,429
Then they moved over to like health and
beauty, grabbed


1771
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:49,289
this shampoo and like these hair clip things.


1772
00:59:50,469 --> 00:59:54,009
Went and grabbed these. All of that stuff
went into that same bag.


1773
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:58,289
They tried to bypass points of sale. Stopped
them, escorted them back here, called you


1774
00:59:59,049 --> 01:00:00,309
guys. Okay. Do you guys have IDs?


1775
01:00:01,989 --> 01:00:02,289
No.


1776
01:00:02,389 --> 01:00:04,229
You don't have... None of you have IDs on you
at all?


1777
01:00:04,529 --> 01:00:04,809
No.


1778
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:05,049
No.


1779
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:06,249
How old are you?


1780
01:00:06,989 --> 01:00:07,049
I'm


1781
01:00:07,769 --> 01:00:08,249
18.


1782
01:00:08,529 --> 01:00:09,009
18? And you?


1783
01:00:09,209 --> 01:00:09,509
17.


1784
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:09,809
17, 20.


1785
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:12,189
Remember what we talked about?


1786
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:14,189
Yeah. First, you... What's your name?


1787
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:14,969
Adriana.


1788
01:00:15,289 --> 01:00:15,969
What's your last name?


1789
01:00:16,229 --> 01:00:17,949
Arteaga, A-R-T-E-A-G-A.


1790
01:00:18,689 --> 01:00:19,349
Give me your bag.


1791
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:23,289
What's your date of birth?


1792
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:25,189
June 12th, six.


1793
01:00:25,309 --> 01:00:27,129
Mm-mm-mm.


1794
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:28,189
2020.


1795
01:00:29,389 --> 01:00:29,689
What's that?


1796
01:00:29,729 --> 01:00:31,249
I don't know.


1797
01:00:31,389 --> 01:00:31,709
Uh,


1798
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:33,749
we'll talk about all that in a few.


1799
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:35,449
How much?


1800
01:00:36,089 --> 01:00:39,269
We'll talk about all that in a few minutes as
far as


1801
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:44,589
what we gotta make them aware of before we
even talk to them. All right. I just want to


1802
01:00:44,969 --> 01:00:46,069
go talk to your mom. Is your mom going to be
all right?


1803
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:48,409
Oh.


1804
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:51,069
Look, it's funny.


1805
01:00:52,089 --> 01:00:52,649
Do I know you?


1806
01:00:53,049 --> 01:00:54,389
No, but you're 17.


1807
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:57,949
Oh, y'all don't know where I'm, where I'm at.
She know what I've been doing.


1808
01:00:58,769 --> 01:01:00,009
She know what she be doing?


1809
01:01:00,309 --> 01:01:03,209
No, she know where I'm at. She knows where
you're d- she knows where you're at.


1810
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:05,109
She don't know about this but, like-


1811
01:01:05,229 --> 01:01:07,089
Are you... What... Do you go to... Are you in
high school?


1812
01:01:07,929 --> 01:01:08,449
You too?


1813
01:01:08,529 --> 01:01:08,809
Mm-hmm.


1814
01:01:10,049 --> 01:01:12,489
What's gonna happen now?


1815
01:01:12,489 --> 01:01:12,949
What's that?


1816
01:01:12,949 --> 01:01:13,309
What's gonna happen now?


1817
01:01:14,459 --> 01:01:16,359
We'll have to conduct an investigation.


1818
01:01:17,199 --> 01:01:19,359
We can try calling home. We'll get like a
trespassing fine or something.


1819
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:20,639
That's not how this works.


1820
01:01:21,099 --> 01:01:22,199
What, we get arrested?


1821
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,559
I don't know. We'll have to conduct an
investigation.


1822
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,360
No.


1823
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:27,780
Well, did y'all... Y'all broke the law,
right?


1824
01:01:28,879 --> 01:01:29,459
Mm-hmm. Yeah.


1825
01:01:29,659 --> 01:01:31,159
And we got called here. So


1826
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,360
we have to conduct an investigation.


1827
01:01:34,779 --> 01:01:35,919
What did they say on the- on-


1828
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:37,239
She just said hold on.


1829
01:01:37,419 --> 01:01:41,779
All right, so go ahead and start watching the
video. It's all good. Everybody's busy, so


1830
01:01:41,779 --> 01:01:42,159
I'll chill. Why would we need to


1831
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:43,519
watch any of it


1832
01:01:44,519 --> 01:01:44,799
when we know what happened?


1833
01:01:44,799 --> 01:01:45,300
Well, you weren't here.


1834
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:50,119
While a cop went to check the CCTV to see the
actual footage of their


1835
01:01:50,159 --> 01:01:54,179
theft, another cop investigated the ladies
outside the camera room.


1836
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,539
Does your mom know where you're at, or dad,
or who do you live with?


1837
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,179
I live with my mom.


1838
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:00,379
Hmm. And you?


1839
01:02:01,059 --> 01:02:01,240
Huh?


1840
01:02:01,479 --> 01:02:02,140
Who do you live with?


1841
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:03,140
My mom.


1842
01:02:03,879 --> 01:02:04,479
Okay.


1843
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:05,999
And she knows where I'm at.


1844
01:02:06,999 --> 01:02:10,899
Is that a group of young individuals out
there your cohorts?


1845
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:11,939
Huh?


1846
01:02:12,259 --> 01:02:14,399
There's a group of kids that look like
they're your age-


1847
01:02:14,399 --> 01:02:14,519
I know


1848
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:16,039
... outside, Like, five or six.


1849
01:02:16,179 --> 01:02:16,499
Five?


1850
01:02:16,499 --> 01:02:16,939
Outside here?


1851
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,459
Yeah, outside of Target.


1852
01:02:19,239 --> 01:02:20,259
Did y'all come here alone?


1853
01:02:20,459 --> 01:02:21,019
Yeah.


1854
01:02:21,099 --> 01:02:21,119
Yeah.


1855
01:02:21,119 --> 01:02:23,019
Okay. No big deal, I don't know y'all.


1856
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:23,699
That's what I was saying.


1857
01:02:23,719 --> 01:02:26,279
It's 'cause of her boyfriend, so I didn't
know if he had brought people over.


1858
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:26,799
Yeah.


1859
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:29,359
That's probably what it is. Why is your shirt
wet?


1860
01:02:29,979 --> 01:02:31,219
We were at the pool.


1861
01:02:32,299 --> 01:02:32,359
At 11:00.


1862
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:32,779
Which one?


1863
01:02:32,819 --> 01:02:37,739
I have my bathing suit on. Um, below the
campground, we went to the open pool.


1864
01:02:37,739 --> 01:02:38,339
You drive?


1865
01:02:39,319 --> 01:02:42,459
She does. So can you just please just leave?


1866
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:44,519
What did I say five minutes ago?


1867
01:02:44,539 --> 01:02:47,739
No, you can't keep on bugging. You have to
leave and be patient.


1868
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:50,959
Well, I'm not bugging. I'm being calm and
patient too. But...


1869
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:52,799
Is that recording?


1870
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:53,879
My camera?


1871
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:55,239
It's supposed to always be recording.


1872
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:56,619
Yeah, it's on. It's recording.


1873
01:02:57,119 --> 01:02:58,739
It always has to be recording.


1874
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:00,739
Well, that's not true. Some people


1875
01:03:00,739 --> 01:03:01,739
[beep]


1876
01:03:01,839 --> 01:03:05,499
Well, I'm in a room with two little girls,
and I ain't gonna be accusing-


1877
01:03:05,499 --> 01:03:06,359
You have to be a man.


1878
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:06,459
[beep]


1879
01:03:07,859 --> 01:03:11,599
My camera's always on. Deputy Doggett, mind
standing by with Mel?


1880
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:12,739
Oh, yeah.


1881
01:03:14,619 --> 01:03:16,139
18 and 17.


1882
01:03:17,239 --> 01:03:18,879
All right. So Doggett's here, so...


1883
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,579
7:44,


1884
01:03:21,279 --> 01:03:22,119
they pass.


1885
01:03:22,839 --> 01:03:25,439
So, who's- who was holding the bag the whole
time?


1886
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:27,459
The, uh, the 15-year-old. Girl in the white.


1887
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:29,239
Okay. And who was taking the items?


1888
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:29,519
Both.


1889
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:30,959
Cool.


1890
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:33,299
Both selecting them, both putting them in the
purse.


1891
01:03:33,299 --> 01:03:33,499
Yeah.


1892
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:34,439
So what do y'all want to do?


1893
01:03:34,759 --> 01:03:36,459
Uh, we're going to prosecute both for
trespass.


1894
01:03:36,899 --> 01:03:37,199
All right.


1895
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:38,579
So you'll see, they'll grab


1896
01:03:39,419 --> 01:03:43,719
14 or 15 items here. The girl in the white
conceals and then the other one conceals


1897
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:45,259
there. And that was the last thing they
selected.


1898
01:03:45,259 --> 01:03:47,459
They kind of walked around the grocery
department for a little bit.


1899
01:03:47,459 --> 01:03:51,799
Like, they even looked at, like, dairy stuff,
like butter and stuff. But they never grabbed


1900
01:03:52,179 --> 01:03:52,499
anything else. Okay,


1901
01:03:53,179 --> 01:03:54,119
cool. Y'all wanna


1902
01:03:55,019 --> 01:03:56,199
ye- yield, prosecute?


1903
01:03:56,379 --> 01:03:56,899
Yes, sir.


1904
01:03:58,679 --> 01:03:59,259
Thank you.


1905
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:04,719
For what?


1906
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,559
Your cell phone.


1907
01:04:06,099 --> 01:04:07,079
He's giving me five.


1908
01:04:07,119 --> 01:04:07,499
Thank you.


1909
01:04:09,439 --> 01:04:09,959
That's gonna be 10-


1910
01:04:09,959 --> 01:04:13,039
Sorry for you to be texting your ex-boyfriend
that's waiting outside for you.


1911
01:04:14,399 --> 01:04:17,299
All right, ladies, I'm going to read this to
you, okay? You have the right to remain


1912
01:04:17,299 --> 01:04:21,079
silent. Anything you say may be used as
evidence against you. You have the right to


1913
01:04:21,479 --> 01:04:22,399
talk to an attorney. Do you understand these
rights?


1914
01:04:23,099 --> 01:04:24,419
It's... Hear me out, okay?


1915
01:04:24,459 --> 01:04:25,819
You do? Do you understand these rights?


1916
01:04:26,379 --> 01:04:26,759
I hear you.


1917
01:04:26,819 --> 01:04:28,759
All right, are you willing to talk to us?


1918
01:04:28,899 --> 01:04:29,219
Yeah.


1919
01:04:29,459 --> 01:04:29,699
Okay.


1920
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:29,959
Yeah.


1921
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:31,179
Sure.


1922
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:31,519
Okay.


1923
01:04:31,859 --> 01:04:34,299
All right, we'll talk to, um, Marie first.


1924
01:04:34,619 --> 01:04:38,159
You, uh, can you wait outside please, Miss
Liliana? Or Lily, whatever your name is.


1925
01:04:39,439 --> 01:04:39,919
Okay.


1926
01:04:41,219 --> 01:04:42,179
Do I have my phone?


1927
01:04:42,399 --> 01:04:42,659
Nope.


1928
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:46,019
So tell me what happened. Why'd you guys come
here?


1929
01:04:46,779 --> 01:04:51,199
Okay, we came here because, um, I wanted to
have a girl's day,


1930
01:04:51,339 --> 01:04:56,179
and I wanted to sleep at her house. So then
we went to the pool first, that's where we


1931
01:04:56,179 --> 01:04:57,639
all went. And then we-


1932
01:04:57,679 --> 01:05:00,439
Turn around. You're good, you can keep
talking.


1933
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:04,999
We came to Target. Uh, she wanted jewelry, I
needed body wash.


1934
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:11,499
And she wanted the chips. And I said, "We
should leave." Like, this


1935
01:05:11,539 --> 01:05:11,799
is...


1936
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:12,759
2:14.


1937
01:05:12,999 --> 01:05:13,059
Yeah.


1938
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:14,299
But I know it's wrong.


1939
01:05:16,479 --> 01:05:16,759
So


1940
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:19,379
talk to me about all these items in here.


1941
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:21,919
So there should be some


1942
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:22,119
[beep]


1943
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:26,419
... better item here. I bought that for me
because I'm not sure. I don't know.


1944
01:05:26,439 --> 01:05:27,559
You bought it or you-


1945
01:05:27,699 --> 01:05:28,479
No, I got those


1946
01:05:29,239 --> 01:05:30,019
from like-


1947
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:31,139
I'm sorry?


1948
01:05:31,519 --> 01:05:32,559
I picked those.


1949
01:05:32,599 --> 01:05:32,939
Okay.


1950
01:05:33,059 --> 01:05:33,559
Out.


1951
01:05:33,939 --> 01:05:34,319
So,


1952
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:36,839
why didn't you pay for it?


1953
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:40,859
I, I honestly have no... I know I should
have, but I-


1954
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:45,799
So if you, if I asked you to stand up right
now and point at all the items you stole,


1955
01:05:46,379 --> 01:05:47,639
would you be able to do that? That you did
and not her?


1956
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:51,959
Uh, probably not, because we, I think we got
the same things.


1957
01:05:52,219 --> 01:05:53,799
Okay. So you guys are both-


1958
01:05:53,819 --> 01:05:54,879
She was looking for dollars.


1959
01:05:55,719 --> 01:05:56,239
Um,


1960
01:05:57,279 --> 01:05:58,919
I mean, it's all both yeah.


1961
01:05:59,759 --> 01:06:01,099
And we also share a lot.


1962
01:06:01,639 --> 01:06:02,999
Whose idea was it to...


1963
01:06:04,479 --> 01:06:05,919
Whose, whose plan was this?


1964
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:07,839
To come here?


1965
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:08,539
To-


1966
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:09,439
To-


1967
01:06:09,439 --> 01:06:09,879
Take from-


1968
01:06:09,919 --> 01:06:12,799
Yeah, to come here and take stuff that you
weren't planning on paying for.


1969
01:06:14,499 --> 01:06:19,239
So originally I wanted to go to Walmart, but
I need to put gas at


1970
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:24,079
Wawa because it's the cheapest. Well, to me,
I think Shell or WalMart is the cheapest.


1971
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:24,719
So,


1972
01:06:25,479 --> 01:06:29,299
so then she was like, "Let's just go to
Target." And I'm like, "Okay, let's just go


1973
01:06:29,359 --> 01:06:30,419
to Target." And I'm like, "Okay, let's just
go to Target instead." But I just need body


1974
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:33,499
wash. So you, you came here with the intent
to, to steal it?


1975
01:06:34,219 --> 01:06:35,219
To get a body wash.


1976
01:06:35,939 --> 01:06:37,859
And jewelry? [beeping]


1977
01:06:38,459 --> 01:06:39,599
But I can pay for it.


1978
01:06:40,299 --> 01:06:42,799
Well, we want to know whose idea was it?


1979
01:06:43,219 --> 01:06:44,679
It wasn't necessarily


1980
01:06:45,399 --> 01:06:50,259
said, like, "Hey, let's go in and do this."
It was just necessarily just done, if that


1981
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:52,579
makes sense. It wasn't planned.


1982
01:06:53,039 --> 01:06:56,039
So when you came in the store, you were
planning on paying for everything that you


1983
01:06:56,459 --> 01:06:56,759
bought? No, nothing was planned.


1984
01:06:56,759 --> 01:06:59,199
Or everything that you stole, you were
planning on paying for it?


1985
01:06:59,479 --> 01:07:01,319
No, like I said, nothing was planned at all.


1986
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:05,359
Like, we just walked in and I said, "I need
body wash," and she said she needs jewelry.


1987
01:07:06,059 --> 01:07:09,279
That's exactly why we went to the jewelry
first. And we just... Okay.


1988
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:12,779
Like, it wasn't necessarily set or planned.


1989
01:07:13,519 --> 01:07:15,579
And then who... So who was holding the, the
bag?


1990
01:07:16,459 --> 01:07:16,959
The bag.


1991
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,599
And you were putting... Did she know you were
putting things in the bag?


1992
01:07:21,425 --> 01:07:23,405
She did? She put things in the bag too?


1993
01:07:25,225 --> 01:07:25,245
No.


1994
01:07:25,265 --> 01:07:26,165
Who took the chips?


1995
01:07:27,385 --> 01:07:27,745
No.


1996
01:07:29,266 --> 01:07:30,025
I don't know. Like that's-


1997
01:07:31,105 --> 01:07:35,926
After investigating the redhead suspect, the
cops investigated the blonde suspect


1998
01:07:36,025 --> 01:07:36,626
alone.


1999
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:37,245
You, like, I can't-


2000
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:37,785
Get up.


2001
01:07:38,525 --> 01:07:38,686
Are you okay?


2002
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:41,565
Okay? I'm trying. Why are you yelling at me?


2003
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:42,905
I told you three times.


2004
01:07:43,265 --> 01:07:45,625
So let me hear your side of the story. Why,
why'd you guys come here?


2005
01:07:45,985 --> 01:07:50,545
Well, we came to get jewelry. The, just like
the fake jewelry because like...


2006
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:52,645
I don't know. We don't have-


2007
01:07:52,645 --> 01:07:53,285
Or, or do you-


2008
01:07:53,285 --> 01:07:54,745
We don't have no money to get it anymore.


2009
01:07:54,866 --> 01:07:55,786
What'd you need it for?


2010
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,925
For me, so I can wear it.


2011
01:07:58,285 --> 01:07:59,565
Just, just to have it?


2012
01:07:59,765 --> 01:08:04,226
Yeah. I would go all gold 'cause I like to
wear gold and I have these and I, I just


2013
01:08:04,265 --> 01:08:06,245
want... I don't... It's not... I wanted more
but-


2014
01:08:06,506 --> 01:08:09,465
So do you come in here with the intent to not
pay for it?


2015
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:15,886
Well, no. But like, I kind of like, I know
like, coming in here I might like,


2016
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:16,725
look,


2017
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:22,065
look at it and try and maybe want it. But,
no.


2018
01:08:23,065 --> 01:08:24,845
But you said you didn't have any money to buy
it.


2019
01:08:25,745 --> 01:08:27,485
Yeah, I don't. I have $2.


2020
01:08:28,345 --> 01:08:30,645
Okay. Whose idea was it to come here?


2021
01:08:31,385 --> 01:08:32,405
Nobody's idea.


2022
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:35,045
It was nobody's idea? You guys just showed up
here?


2023
01:08:35,565 --> 01:08:37,205
No, we come to Target all the time.


2024
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:37,626
Okay.


2025
01:08:38,345 --> 01:08:40,066
So you just figured you were gonna come hang
out?


2026
01:08:40,745 --> 01:08:43,785
Yeah. Well, a lot of people walk around here.
We were gonna meet her boyfriend here too.


2027
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:45,665
Well, ex-boyfriend.


2028
01:08:46,765 --> 01:08:47,405
And how old are you?


2029
01:08:47,805 --> 01:08:48,345
17.


2030
01:08:48,665 --> 01:08:49,605
You're still in high school?


2031
01:08:49,786 --> 01:08:49,966
Mm-hmm.


2032
01:08:50,286 --> 01:08:52,826
Does your mom know that you're here? Have you
talked to her?


2033
01:08:52,886 --> 01:08:53,146
Mm-hmm.


2034
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:54,646
So she knows you're here?


2035
01:08:54,886 --> 01:08:55,106
Yes.


2036
01:08:55,206 --> 01:08:57,845
Did she know you were coming here and was
stealing stuff or-


2037
01:08:58,906 --> 01:08:58,926
Mm-hmm.


2038
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:01,245
She didn't ask how you were gonna buy stuff
with no money?


2039
01:09:01,945 --> 01:09:05,485
No, I don't like, it's like informal what I'm
doing.


2040
01:09:06,445 --> 01:09:09,025
I would, I will, I usually would have my dad
send me money.


2041
01:09:10,305 --> 01:09:10,705
Okay.


2042
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:14,405
So you... Who was carrying this bag right
here?


2043
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:16,765
I was carrying it, but it's not my bag.


2044
01:09:16,765 --> 01:09:18,265
Okay.


2045
01:09:19,145 --> 01:09:23,105
Did you... You were putting stuff in the bag?
Did you know she was putting stuff in the


2046
01:09:23,605 --> 01:09:24,325
bag? Did you know she was putting stuff in
the bag? I did, yeah.


2047
01:09:24,845 --> 01:09:25,705
Do you know if she did?


2048
01:09:26,185 --> 01:09:26,485
Yeah.


2049
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:27,365
She did too?


2050
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:29,365
Was on camera so...


2051
01:09:30,005 --> 01:09:31,205
No, I'm just asking.


2052
01:09:32,425 --> 01:09:36,865
So if we asked you to like stand up and point
at the items that you put in here


2053
01:09:37,005 --> 01:09:41,985
specifically? Oh, I, I mean, I got the chips.
But all that jewelry, like, I'm not gonna be


2054
01:09:42,005 --> 01:09:44,525
able to look at all that and like pull out...
I could


2055
01:09:45,225 --> 01:09:47,185
get a couple. I didn't take a lot of jewelry.


2056
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,065
Well, there's like- There's a lot of jewelry.


2057
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:50,605
Yeah, I didn't take much though.


2058
01:09:50,945 --> 01:09:52,985
There's like 15 or 20 items in here.


2059
01:09:53,065 --> 01:09:55,225
Would you like me to try to look at it and
film you?


2060
01:09:55,965 --> 01:09:56,565
Oh, if you can.


2061
01:09:56,585 --> 01:09:58,325
Yeah, it'd be great. Yeah, go ahead and do
that.


2062
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:00,385
Because I didn't grab much.


2063
01:10:01,505 --> 01:10:02,605
I did grab this.


2064
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,305
Mm-hmm. [bag rustling]


2065
01:10:05,305 --> 01:10:06,305
That's it.


2066
01:10:06,405 --> 01:10:07,405
Mm-hmm.


2067
01:10:07,505 --> 01:10:13,105
[bag rustling]


2068
01:10:13,105 --> 01:10:14,465
These all came together.


2069
01:10:14,985 --> 01:10:16,145
Where were the package photos?


2070
01:10:16,145 --> 01:10:19,065
This, I don't know. [bag rustling]


2071
01:10:19,525 --> 01:10:22,025
Did you take a package off maybe?


2072
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:26,585
Yeah. That's bottom, that's bottom. [bag
rustling] I didn't get... Oh wait.


2073
01:10:26,585 --> 01:10:30,345
[bag rustling] That's it.


2074
01:10:30,345 --> 01:10:31,525
Okay. Is there anything in your pockets?


2075
01:10:32,025 --> 01:10:32,145
No.


2076
01:10:32,345 --> 01:10:33,605
Can you turn around?


2077
01:10:34,045 --> 01:10:35,925
Turn around. Turn around.


2078
01:10:37,685 --> 01:10:37,845
No way, girl, no way.


2079
01:10:37,845 --> 01:10:38,945
Unless she has side pockets.


2080
01:10:39,205 --> 01:10:40,665
Okay. Over here.


2081
01:10:40,865 --> 01:10:41,505
I do have.


2082
01:10:41,765 --> 01:10:42,245
Over here.


2083
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:43,865
I have some more gear.


2084
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:44,725
How'd you guys get here?


2085
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:46,605
A car. Just got in one.


2086
01:10:47,465 --> 01:10:50,405
You ever done anything like this before?
First time or...


2087
01:10:51,105 --> 01:10:52,285
So what was the-


2088
01:10:52,305 --> 01:10:53,085
No, I got caught.


2089
01:10:53,845 --> 01:10:53,865
Nevermind. Okay.


2090
01:10:53,865 --> 01:10:55,905
What was the straw that broke the camel's
back?


2091
01:10:55,905 --> 01:11:00,885
Like why was, why was today the day that
we're like, "All right, I want some jewelry


2092
01:11:00,885 --> 01:11:01,145
and I'm not paying for it"?


2093
01:11:02,185 --> 01:11:05,945
Well, like... [cell phone ringing] I don't
know. I guess I'm a senior.


2094
01:11:06,425 --> 01:11:08,345
Hey, Gianna, it's okay. Don't freak out.


2095
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:09,445
Okay.


2096
01:11:09,445 --> 01:11:10,325
Let them do what they doing.


2097
01:11:10,325 --> 01:11:13,645
All right, Adriana. So can you turn around
and put your hands behind your back, please?


2098
01:11:14,485 --> 01:11:15,265
Let me see the keys.


2099
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:16,525
Okay.


2100
01:11:17,905 --> 01:11:17,925
No, you guys have to leave.


2101
01:11:17,925 --> 01:11:21,725
Being placed under arrest for petty theft and
contributing to the delinquency of a minor.


2102
01:11:24,805 --> 01:11:26,025
Do you remember where you parked your car?


2103
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:27,365
Yeah, I think.


2104
01:11:29,765 --> 01:11:31,005
You think?


2105
01:11:31,485 --> 01:11:32,885
It's straight. I think.


2106
01:11:34,185 --> 01:11:35,745
Are you being honest about your name?


2107
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:38,525
I am. It's pretty. It's tight.


2108
01:11:40,085 --> 01:11:41,965
It's tight? I can fit my whole finger in
there.


2109
01:11:42,505 --> 01:11:42,905
This one?


2110
01:11:43,825 --> 01:11:44,525
She should carry on.


2111
01:11:44,525 --> 01:11:48,145
All right. Let's let her... Thank you. You
wanna stand by with her while we escort her


2112
01:11:48,185 --> 01:11:48,665
over? Yeah.


2113
01:11:50,405 --> 01:11:50,945
Wait.


2114
01:11:51,585 --> 01:11:52,665
Wait [laughing] . Wait.


2115
01:11:54,565 --> 01:11:55,145
Wait [laughing] .


2116
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,245
Yo, get over there.


2117
01:11:56,365 --> 01:11:57,125
Eyes and feet in the air.


2118
01:11:57,145 --> 01:12:02,125
The cops took her to the vehicle, thinking
she had left all the stolen items inside.


2119
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:06,365
Little did they know, she had a few hidden
somewhere rather unusual.


2120
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:07,105
Stay right here.


2121
01:12:08,285 --> 01:12:09,805
Is there anything in your pockets?


2122
01:12:10,305 --> 01:12:13,545
Before we do that, let's see if we have a
female to meet. All right.


2123
01:12:13,545 --> 01:12:16,445
When we finish our investigation, we'll be
happy to answer your questions.


2124
01:12:17,425 --> 01:12:18,205
I have here.


2125
01:12:18,865 --> 01:12:22,805
Here, here. I literally have this. Here. Take
it.


2126
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:23,425
[crying]


2127
01:12:23,425 --> 01:12:24,945
You can't even have that. You're not old
enough.


2128
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:25,605
Take it. [crying]


2129
01:12:26,405 --> 01:12:27,225
Where's your car at?


2130
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:29,625
I don't know.


2131
01:12:30,145 --> 01:12:31,365
How do you not know where you parked?


2132
01:12:32,405 --> 01:12:34,365
All right. We'll, we'll use your keys and
we'll find out.


2133
01:12:34,365 --> 01:12:34,705
Wait.


2134
01:12:35,305 --> 01:12:36,745
Am I getting arrested? [crying]


2135
01:12:36,765 --> 01:12:36,945
Yeah.


2136
01:12:37,325 --> 01:12:37,665
Yes.


2137
01:12:37,665 --> 01:12:39,445
For petty theft and contributing to the
delinquency of a minor.


2138
01:12:39,445 --> 01:12:40,065
You got a felony.


2139
01:12:40,705 --> 01:12:41,245
It's not good.


2140
01:12:41,245 --> 01:12:41,265
What?


2141
01:12:41,265 --> 01:12:41,785
It's a felony.


2142
01:12:42,105 --> 01:12:43,365
What does that mean?


2143
01:12:43,605 --> 01:12:44,225
It means you-


2144
01:12:44,225 --> 01:12:44,585
Um, you help-


2145
01:12:44,705 --> 01:12:45,405
It's a harder charge


2146
01:12:45,405 --> 01:12:47,585
... you take the steal with her and she's a
minor.


2147
01:12:48,245 --> 01:12:52,745
A felony is a more severe charge than a
misdemeanor. You're being charged with both,


2148
01:12:53,485 --> 01:12:55,005
so it's not good. Any prior theft
convictions?


2149
01:12:56,645 --> 01:12:57,805
Did they say if you know it's coming?


2150
01:12:57,945 --> 01:12:58,245
Yes.


2151
01:12:59,905 --> 01:12:59,925
2025.


2152
01:12:59,925 --> 01:13:02,485
[laughing] Can you please let go of my arm?
I'm not gonna move.


2153
01:13:02,505 --> 01:13:03,825
I, no, I have to hold onto you.


2154
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:05,225
So you're being arres-


2155
01:13:05,285 --> 01:13:06,645
Hold onto her.


2156
01:13:06,645 --> 01:13:07,085
Miss Ma'am.


2157
01:13:07,085 --> 01:13:08,385
[crying] No, I just don't like it.


2158
01:13:08,385 --> 01:13:09,085
Miss, Miss Adriana.


2159
01:13:09,205 --> 01:13:10,505
I don't like it at all, bro.


2160
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:14,545
It's good. You're being arrested for petty
theft, all right, because you stole from


2161
01:13:14,605 --> 01:13:15,285
Target. You understand that?


2162
01:13:15,425 --> 01:13:16,185
I understand that.


2163
01:13:16,185 --> 01:13:18,625
Okay. And contributing to the delinquency of
a minor.


2164
01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,885
Your friend there is 17 and you contributed
to her stealing.


2165
01:13:21,885 --> 01:13:26,767
You contributed to her breaking the law, and
she's under the age of, uh, 18.So because you


2166
01:13:26,827 --> 01:13:28,727
coerced a juvenile to break-


2167
01:13:28,727 --> 01:13:30,047
I didn't coerce her.


2168
01:13:30,047 --> 01:13:33,487
Well, you're an adult, right? It doesn't feel
like it, but you are.


2169
01:13:33,907 --> 01:13:35,127
So it may not feel like it, but


2170
01:13:35,768 --> 01:13:37,248
you make these grownup decisions.


2171
01:13:37,907 --> 01:13:39,328
Wait, what does that mean?


2172
01:13:39,688 --> 01:13:40,467
What does what mean?


2173
01:13:41,107 --> 01:13:42,107
What do you mean?


2174
01:13:42,727 --> 01:13:47,587
W-what do you mean when you say "I'm getting
taken in"? Like, what do you mean?


2175
01:13:47,587 --> 01:13:48,407
I'm going to jail?


2176
01:13:48,407 --> 01:13:49,288
You're going to jail.


2177
01:13:50,147 --> 01:13:52,847
You'll get booked in. You'll be g- given a
bond. Someone can bond you out.


2178
01:13:52,867 --> 01:13:54,267
If not, you'll see a judge in the morning.


2179
01:13:55,407 --> 01:13:55,427
How much?


2180
01:13:55,427 --> 01:13:55,887
I don't know.


2181
01:13:55,887 --> 01:13:56,028
[crying]


2182
01:13:56,028 --> 01:13:58,328
The bond, uh, probably, I would say,


2183
01:13:59,307 --> 01:14:00,747
1,500, maybe 2,000.


2184
01:14:00,747 --> 01:14:01,148
[gasps]


2185
01:14:01,947 --> 01:14:03,488
All that pizza money might pay off.


2186
01:14:04,208 --> 01:14:07,367
No, it won't, bro. [gasps]


2187
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:09,587
Am I going


2188
01:14:10,467 --> 01:14:11,907
to prison?


2189
01:14:11,907 --> 01:14:14,087
You're not gonna go to prison. You're going
to jail.


2190
01:14:14,567 --> 01:14:15,267
I don't know what that means.


2191
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,107
You'll get booked in... You'll get booked
into the jail.


2192
01:14:18,028 --> 01:14:19,388
They'll give you a bond. Get you out
somewhere.


2193
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:21,868
That means I'm gonna be with people that are
in jail.


2194
01:14:22,047 --> 01:14:22,387
Right.


2195
01:14:23,067 --> 01:14:25,147
Wait, no, I can't.


2196
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:26,447
It's just what's gonna happen.


2197
01:14:26,747 --> 01:14:28,047
No, please, I can't.


2198
01:14:28,047 --> 01:14:29,047
Unless somebody can bond you out fast enough.


2199
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:31,967
They will literally... I can't. [sobs]


2200
01:14:32,007 --> 01:14:34,147
Go see a judge in the morning if you can't
get out by tonight.


2201
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:36,327
And then that'll be the judge's decision if
you go home tomorrow.


2202
01:14:36,327 --> 01:14:37,807
Can I move my hair?


2203
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:41,007
Thank you.


2204
01:14:41,707 --> 01:14:44,747
Wait, why can't I just sit in the cell thing?


2205
01:14:44,967 --> 01:14:45,867
That's not up to me.


2206
01:14:46,567 --> 01:14:48,607
I can't go to prison like this.


2207
01:14:48,607 --> 01:14:51,147
You're not going to prison. Jail. Prison's
different.


2208
01:14:52,027 --> 01:14:55,207
So that's her car, the one with the lights
that look like the car's about to die.


2209
01:14:55,727 --> 01:14:57,987
Do you have anything on you, uh, Adriana?


2210
01:14:59,247 --> 01:14:59,727
What do you have


2211
01:15:00,507 --> 01:15:02,707
aside from the vape? Got any marijuana on
you?


2212
01:15:03,447 --> 01:15:06,187
Any drugs? Anything tucked in your areas?


2213
01:15:07,667 --> 01:15:08,267
What do you have?


2214
01:15:08,547 --> 01:15:09,447
Can you let go for a second?


2215
01:15:09,447 --> 01:15:10,627
What do you have, Adriana?


2216
01:15:10,707 --> 01:15:11,207
Tell us what you have.


2217
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
Oh, it was just a candy.


2218
01:15:13,627 --> 01:15:14,107
That's it?


2219
01:15:14,207 --> 01:15:14,547
Yeah.


2220
01:15:15,347 --> 01:15:17,027
What kinda candy? Like a THC?


2221
01:15:17,627 --> 01:15:17,927
What?


2222
01:15:18,007 --> 01:15:21,507
Is it like THC or like a gummy? Or just like
a regular, like, Skittles or something?


2223
01:15:22,487 --> 01:15:22,887
Okay.


2224
01:15:23,547 --> 01:15:24,127
Where is it?


2225
01:15:26,907 --> 01:15:28,307
It's in- it's in your underwear?


2226
01:15:30,167 --> 01:15:31,107
Or is it in your pants?


2227
01:15:32,967 --> 01:15:34,587
What are you d- Why is it in there?


2228
01:15:35,147 --> 01:15:39,027
Because I knew something was gonna happen
'cause I'm 18 and I didn't know what to do.


2229
01:15:39,047 --> 01:15:41,687
Like, I should have never fucking that way.


2230
01:15:41,747 --> 01:15:43,167
You know what tampering with evidence is?


2231
01:15:43,527 --> 01:15:46,227
I didn't tamp... [crying] I don't know what's
going on, bro.


2232
01:15:46,227 --> 01:15:49,207
Well, you put it in there with the intent to
conceal it from...


2233
01:15:50,027 --> 01:15:51,387
What is it? Just a... What kinda candy is it?


2234
01:15:51,387 --> 01:15:56,347
It's just Twix. I swear to God, bro. [gasps]
I mean Twizzlers, whatever the


2235
01:15:56,367 --> 01:15:57,867
hell you call them. [cries]


2236
01:15:57,867 --> 01:15:58,207
Mm-hmm.


2237
01:15:58,867 --> 01:15:59,167
Can you


2238
01:16:00,087 --> 01:16:00,987
move my hair, please?


2239
01:16:01,347 --> 01:16:01,647
You got it from here? What?


2240
01:16:01,927 --> 01:16:03,707
Can you just move it? Uh, my hair is stuck.


2241
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:04,487
You got it from here?


2242
01:16:04,587 --> 01:16:06,627
Yes. [sniffs]


2243
01:16:07,247 --> 01:16:07,507
Oh, shit, listen, bro.


2244
01:16:07,507 --> 01:16:11,787
Why... Where did you... When- did you grab it
when you first walked in or when you were


2245
01:16:11,787 --> 01:16:13,467
leaving or? [sniffs]


2246
01:16:13,467 --> 01:16:14,127
When you were leaving?


2247
01:16:15,807 --> 01:16:15,867
Yeah.


2248
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,727
Does your ex-boyfriend have any guns or
anything?


2249
01:16:18,687 --> 01:16:18,927
No?


2250
01:16:20,547 --> 01:16:23,947
What, are we gonna have to worry about him
getting mad at us and trying to shoot at us


2251
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:24,527
or anything? No.


2252
01:16:25,387 --> 01:16:27,227
He just wants to know how much the bond is.


2253
01:16:27,867 --> 01:16:28,567
Oh, that's cute.


2254
01:16:28,927 --> 01:16:29,687
How old is he?


2255
01:16:29,987 --> 01:16:30,687
18.


2256
01:16:31,287 --> 01:16:32,187
What's he do for work?


2257
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,067
Anthony's Pizza, just like me.


2258
01:16:35,207 --> 01:16:36,547
Lean up against the car, Adriana.


2259
01:16:36,547 --> 01:16:38,167
[Sniffs] Lean up or don't lean up?


2260
01:16:38,167 --> 01:16:39,987
No, lean up on the car. You're good. Just
relax.


2261
01:16:40,227 --> 01:16:41,387
I know it's a lot going on, but-


2262
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:44,627
No, I just don't like it when people touch
me.


2263
01:16:44,947 --> 01:16:46,707
Well, when you get arrested, that's what
happens.


2264
01:16:46,707 --> 01:16:50,807
[laughs] I g- I just... I know, but I, I s- I
just-


2265
01:16:51,207 --> 01:16:52,807
Kinda forfeit that right.


2266
01:16:53,007 --> 01:16:56,027
That's not fair. I j- I really [laughs] don't
like when people touch me.


2267
01:16:56,027 --> 01:16:58,167
That's why I don't wanna go to jail, bro.


2268
01:16:58,527 --> 01:17:02,287
Well, listen. Listen to me, all right? I
don't... I think you're, I think you're a


2269
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:04,147
nice girl. I think you made a mistake, but-


2270
01:17:04,187 --> 01:17:06,447
I did, but I don't wanna get touched in jail,
bro.


2271
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:07,707
Adriana, listen. L- listen to what I'm
saying.


2272
01:17:08,467 --> 01:17:09,027
Can you listen?


2273
01:17:09,027 --> 01:17:09,627
[sobbing] Yes.


2274
01:17:09,807 --> 01:17:13,827
Okay. As long as you do as you're told and
you don't do anything silly,


2275
01:17:14,507 --> 01:17:15,587
it's gonna be smooth sailing.


2276
01:17:15,587 --> 01:17:17,707
I'm not. I'm a fucking straight-A student.


2277
01:17:17,707 --> 01:17:18,207
Adriana, come right here.


2278
01:17:18,227 --> 01:17:19,667
4.0, bro.


2279
01:17:19,707 --> 01:17:20,187
Okay.


2280
01:17:20,187 --> 01:17:23,907
[sniffs] That's my problem. I don't know what
goes on in jail.


2281
01:17:23,907 --> 01:17:25,947
I do not wanna get touched by nobody.


2282
01:17:26,007 --> 01:17:30,987
Okay, well, as long as you behave and you
don't do anything raunchy, you'll be all


2283
01:17:31,187 --> 01:17:33,627
good. Bro, this is fantastic, bro.


2284
01:17:34,947 --> 01:17:36,827
Yeah, you made a mistake is all.


2285
01:17:36,967 --> 01:17:41,107
I did. But the crazy part is I'm not supposed
to be hanging out with her.


2286
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:45,627
My mother was like, "Don't do it." 'Cause
every time I hang out with her, cops getting


2287
01:17:45,627 --> 01:17:47,667
fucked with. And look what you did. Now
you're going to jail.


2288
01:17:47,907 --> 01:17:50,187
Yes, exactly. [sobs]


2289
01:17:50,187 --> 01:17:51,747
And she's not going to jail. You know why?


2290
01:17:51,747 --> 01:17:54,027
I know. 'Cause she doesn't give a fuck and
she's 17.


2291
01:17:54,027 --> 01:17:57,187
'Cause she's 17. So she's gonna get charges
forwarded up and


2292
01:17:58,007 --> 01:17:59,327
slap on the wrist, essentially.


2293
01:17:59,327 --> 01:18:02,967
[laughs] Bro, I don't wanna go to jail, bro.


2294
01:18:03,047 --> 01:18:05,787
I mean, you'll probably get it expunged and
be all good.


2295
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:07,947
I don't know what that means.


2296
01:18:08,207 --> 01:18:08,787
So because you-


2297
01:18:08,787 --> 01:18:09,287
I really don't.


2298
01:18:09,287 --> 01:18:13,567
Because you will be getting a theft charge on
your record, which goes with you forever.


2299
01:18:13,587 --> 01:18:14,427
Oh, my God.


2300
01:18:14,747 --> 01:18:18,227
So you'll have to get that expunged if you
ever want, like, a real job or anything.


2301
01:18:18,227 --> 01:18:21,347
I can't have that on my record. My record's
just perfect.


2302
01:18:21,847 --> 01:18:23,007
Yeah, until today.


2303
01:18:23,627 --> 01:18:25,247
But I can get that removed?


2304
01:18:26,507 --> 01:18:30,247
You can get it expunged, which means, like,
nobody will ever be able to see it.


2305
01:18:31,267 --> 01:18:35,107
But you'll have to... If you ever get, like,
a government job or anything, they'll still-


2306
01:18:35,167 --> 01:18:35,787
Can I be a nurse?


2307
01:18:36,507 --> 01:18:37,267
Yeah, you can be a nurse.


2308
01:18:37,907 --> 01:18:41,607
I mean, you're only 18. I mean, you made a
silly mistake at the age of 18, which


2309
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:45,247
happens, but- I know, but I'm literally going
to college after this.


2310
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,047
[sighs]


2311
01:18:46,047 --> 01:18:47,507
Yeah, you have to tell them about this.


2312
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:49,807
I have to tell my college?


2313
01:18:50,307 --> 01:18:53,747
Yeah, or else they'll revoke your
application. Where you, where'd you apply to?


2314
01:18:54,667 --> 01:18:57,947
I wanna apply to UCF to become a pediatric
nurse.


2315
01:18:58,647 --> 01:18:59,607
And did you already apply?


2316
01:19:00,267 --> 01:19:01,407
I was going to.


2317
01:19:01,627 --> 01:19:05,627
Well, on your application, it's gonna ask if
you've ever been arrested or charged or


2318
01:19:05,687 --> 01:19:07,307
convicted of any crime, and you're gonna have
to disclose that.


2319
01:19:07,787 --> 01:19:11,227
Because if you lie and they do a background
investigation, then you'll be disqualified


2320
01:19:11,227 --> 01:19:11,827
from any applications.


2321
01:19:12,087 --> 01:19:13,607
Wait, I have a question.


2322
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:13,687
Sure.


2323
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:15,507
Are they gonna make me take my clothes off?


2324
01:19:16,047 --> 01:19:18,927
Um, I don't think so. I mean, you don't have
any


2325
01:19:19,007 --> 01:19:19,507
on you, right?


2326
01:19:19,627 --> 01:19:19,967
No.


2327
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:23,047
They don't us- they don't usually strip
searches unless it's for a narcotics-related


2328
01:19:23,627 --> 01:19:25,387
deal or- I really don't. Like, I swear.


2329
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,307
Uh, good evening, Deputy Liptak.


2330
01:19:28,229 --> 01:19:28,949
Hello, ma'am. How are you?


2331
01:19:28,949 --> 01:19:32,529
She's, she has some, she said she has some
candy or something tucked in her


2332
01:19:33,429 --> 01:19:33,630
shorts.


2333
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,449
I know you.


2334
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:36,910
Do you know me? Probably, I grew up here.


2335
01:19:37,729 --> 01:19:42,709
I know you. I know you 'cause I remember last
year I had a boyfriend, and this old man


2336
01:19:42,729 --> 01:19:45,730
smacked him, and we called the cops. And I
liked your tattoo.


2337
01:19:46,130 --> 01:19:50,049
Okay. Well, nice to see you again. Well,
obviously not in these circumstances.


2338
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:51,909
Um, but I'm gonna ask you before I-


2339
01:19:52,009 --> 01:19:52,509
Here's a Skittle?


2340
01:19:52,509 --> 01:19:55,310
... search, obviously. Do you have anything
hidden anywhere for-


2341
01:19:55,310 --> 01:19:56,470
Yeah, I got you one.


2342
01:19:56,630 --> 01:19:58,409
Just right there? Okay, because I'm just
gonna let you know-


2343
01:19:58,409 --> 01:19:58,589
And then two


2344
01:19:58,589 --> 01:20:01,049
... once you take it, if it goes into the
jail, it becomes a felony.


2345
01:20:01,189 --> 01:20:01,689
Okay. I know.


2346
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:01,709
Okay?


2347
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:02,429
I don't want you to take it.


2348
01:20:02,429 --> 01:20:07,150
The female cop searches her body and takes
Skittles out of her pants.


2349
01:20:07,749 --> 01:20:10,289
And I might have my rings in here. You might
wanna check.


2350
01:20:10,289 --> 01:20:11,630
Yeah, I'm gonna go through all your pockets,
all right?


2351
01:20:11,769 --> 01:20:13,289
Wait, are you gonna throw away my rings?


2352
01:20:13,449 --> 01:20:14,289
Am I gonna throw them away?


2353
01:20:14,289 --> 01:20:15,149
[laughs] Okay.


2354
01:20:15,669 --> 01:20:15,850
All right then.


2355
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,089
They're either in there or in my car.


2356
01:20:17,089 --> 01:20:18,330
I'm gonna guess they're still up there.


2357
01:20:18,929 --> 01:20:21,689
No, that's mine for sure, that's not from
Target. I swear to God.


2358
01:20:21,689 --> 01:20:22,089
I can, you should-


2359
01:20:22,089 --> 01:20:22,170
What is it then?


2360
01:20:22,170 --> 01:20:23,789
You should see the pictures on my phone. I
swear to God.


2361
01:20:23,869 --> 01:20:25,189
Can you just do my favorite face, just there?


2362
01:20:25,429 --> 01:20:25,949
Oh, sorry.


2363
01:20:25,969 --> 01:20:26,569
No, you're good.


2364
01:20:27,229 --> 01:20:28,209
Do you have a bra on you?


2365
01:20:28,229 --> 01:20:32,889
Uh, you can check. It's, it's a, a bikini, so
you could really just pull my shirt up. It's


2366
01:20:32,889 --> 01:20:33,589
a bikini, so you could really just pull my
shirt up. It's a bikini, I swear. You have a


2367
01:20:33,609 --> 01:20:33,889
bikini on? Yeah.


2368
01:20:34,149 --> 01:20:36,829
Nothing hidden in any female spots?


2369
01:20:36,869 --> 01:20:37,589
Mm-mm.


2370
01:20:37,729 --> 01:20:38,449
No? All right.


2371
01:20:39,329 --> 01:20:39,949
Oh, she all good?


2372
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:44,949
Yeah. [crying] Please. [cries] I just wanna


2373
01:20:45,029 --> 01:20:47,009
talk to the female.


2374
01:20:48,709 --> 01:20:51,669
She's the only girl here. [crying] .


2375
01:20:52,889 --> 01:20:54,909
I wanna talk to you.


2376
01:20:55,769 --> 01:20:59,329
I wanna talk to you. They won't let me talk
to you.


2377
01:21:00,009 --> 01:21:03,789
He wouldn't let me talk to you. He was being
rude.


2378
01:21:04,429 --> 01:21:09,069
I just wanna talk to a female. They need to
let me out of this car.


2379
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:10,929
She was caught, uh,


2380
01:21:11,529 --> 01:21:12,529
stealing some items.


2381
01:21:13,649 --> 01:21:13,809
Jewelry.


2382
01:21:13,809 --> 01:21:18,269
Jewelry and snacks and such. She's at the
Target here on 100 in, uh, Palm Coast.


2383
01:21:18,269 --> 01:21:18,969
Are you able to come get her?


2384
01:21:19,949 --> 01:21:21,449
Uh, yes. We're on our way.


2385
01:21:21,529 --> 01:21:23,429
All right. Let's go. Let's go.


2386
01:21:23,909 --> 01:21:24,629
Thank you. I'm gonna grab my-


2387
01:21:24,669 --> 01:21:25,849
Go, or I escort you.


2388
01:21:25,849 --> 01:21:28,629
I'm not. Oh, well, can you grab it then? Oh,
you can, oh.


2389
01:21:28,629 --> 01:21:28,909
[laughs]


2390
01:21:28,909 --> 01:21:29,689
Ma'am, just please-


2391
01:21:29,729 --> 01:21:31,689
All right, don't be grabbing me like that.


2392
01:21:31,849 --> 01:21:32,669
Just keep walking. Just keep walking.


2393
01:21:33,609 --> 01:21:35,689
Yo. Don't do that, please, because that hurt.


2394
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:38,189
And I'm being calm, but that hurt.


2395
01:21:38,189 --> 01:21:41,549
Yeah, well, now, now we're gonna hold onto
you because you wanted to fight in there.


2396
01:21:41,849 --> 01:21:44,789
Who wanted to fight? Let go of me, bro. I'm
not even resisting.


2397
01:21:44,789 --> 01:21:46,189
I'm not gonna let go of you now.


2398
01:21:46,429 --> 01:21:48,309
I'm not even resisting, bro.


2399
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:52,709
Can you please let go of me? That's it,
hurts. I'm not even resisting, bro.


2400
01:21:52,889 --> 01:21:53,329
Stop.


2401
01:21:53,589 --> 01:21:55,909
Let go of me. Give me my [censored] phone.


2402
01:21:56,589 --> 01:21:57,169
Y'all twisted it off.


2403
01:21:57,169 --> 01:21:58,949
You'll get your phone when your mom comes.


2404
01:21:59,149 --> 01:22:02,709
And I'm not going in no damn car. I can sit
out here and wait for my mother.


2405
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:03,389
You're gonna sit in the car.


2406
01:22:04,409 --> 01:22:05,069
Get off of me.


2407
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:05,609
Yeah, I do.


2408
01:22:05,609 --> 01:22:08,369
I'll put some cuffs on. Get off of my arm.


2409
01:22:08,849 --> 01:22:10,429
Here, get over here. Put your hands behind
your back.


2410
01:22:10,429 --> 01:22:13,589
Get off of my [censored] arm, bro. Hey, just
chill.


2411
01:22:13,589 --> 01:22:13,609
Chill, chill.


2412
01:22:13,609 --> 01:22:14,309
No, bro.


2413
01:22:14,469 --> 01:22:15,089
Just relax.


2414
01:22:15,089 --> 01:22:15,409
Don't push her, chill.


2415
01:22:15,409 --> 01:22:17,709
'Cause, 'cause why are they, like, grabbing
me so hard?


2416
01:22:17,709 --> 01:22:17,789
But we're telling you to just chill.


2417
01:22:17,789 --> 01:22:19,089
Can you put these on me?


2418
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:20,229
He's gonna put these on you.


2419
01:22:20,229 --> 01:22:20,529
Why is he putting these on me?


2420
01:22:20,529 --> 01:22:21,329
I'm gonna search you.


2421
01:22:21,529 --> 01:22:21,969
Chill.


2422
01:22:22,829 --> 01:22:26,969
Shortly after her arrest, her boyfriend
showed up to show some mercy.


2423
01:22:27,129 --> 01:22:28,029
Is that her arm again?


2424
01:22:28,029 --> 01:22:28,789
I'll just stand, I'll just chill.


2425
01:22:28,889 --> 01:22:29,509
You can sit on the bench. Okay.


2426
01:22:29,509 --> 01:22:31,229
I'll just sit like this. I don't wanna sit in
the car.


2427
01:22:31,369 --> 01:22:32,129
And who are you to her?


2428
01:22:32,309 --> 01:22:32,869
Her boyfriend.


2429
01:22:33,349 --> 01:22:33,889
And what's your name?


2430
01:22:33,969 --> 01:22:34,469
Joaquin.


2431
01:22:34,469 --> 01:22:35,269
[cries]


2432
01:22:35,269 --> 01:22:36,449
Do you wanna talk to Joaquin?


2433
01:22:38,389 --> 01:22:38,429
No.


2434
01:22:38,429 --> 01:22:38,709
Hey.


2435
01:22:38,869 --> 01:22:39,189
Come here.


2436
01:22:39,309 --> 01:22:41,229
You good. Do your mom know? Oh, my bad.


2437
01:22:41,309 --> 01:22:44,209
Okay, um, tell my mom I have money.


2438
01:22:44,529 --> 01:22:45,929
We got money. We, we getting you out.


2439
01:22:45,929 --> 01:22:47,269
We got you. We got you. We gon get it. We
getting you out tonight.


2440
01:22:47,269 --> 01:22:48,789
We getting you out. You getting a bond. We
staying up all night for you.


2441
01:22:48,849 --> 01:22:50,329
Okay, I'm gonna pay you back. I-


2442
01:22:50,329 --> 01:22:51,429
No, you're good. Don't worry about that.


2443
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:52,609
Don't even stress about that. Just breathe.


2444
01:22:52,609 --> 01:22:52,689
Just breathe.


2445
01:22:52,689 --> 01:22:52,829
Take a deep breath.


2446
01:22:52,849 --> 01:22:55,189
And don't do, don't do what Lily was doing,
fighting with the cop.


2447
01:22:55,189 --> 01:22:56,029
I don't fight with the cops.


2448
01:22:56,049 --> 01:22:58,089
Exactly. Be respectful. They're being nice to
you.


2449
01:22:58,089 --> 01:22:58,849
I just, I kind of, I can't breathe in here.


2450
01:22:59,169 --> 01:22:59,189
Okay.


2451
01:22:59,289 --> 01:23:03,149
I shouldn't tell her to talk, but I feel like
an accomplishment 'cause you pulled me over


2452
01:23:03,349 --> 01:23:03,469
when I was little. Did I?


2453
01:23:03,469 --> 01:23:04,589
When you were asking if I had my license.


2454
01:23:04,609 --> 01:23:05,249
Okay, look, look at me.


2455
01:23:05,249 --> 01:23:07,369
You thought I was literally young, like, I
was little, bro, like-


2456
01:23:07,469 --> 01:23:08,069
I gave you a ticket?


2457
01:23:08,449 --> 01:23:10,629
Nah, you let me go because I was running late
to school.


2458
01:23:11,449 --> 01:23:11,689
That was you.


2459
01:23:11,689 --> 01:23:12,609
Oh, I was a nice guy.


2460
01:23:13,209 --> 01:23:13,689
Nah, you came to


2461
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:14,329
That's funny.


2462
01:23:16,349 --> 01:23:17,829
Yeah, that's why, that's why I came to say
so.


2463
01:23:17,849 --> 01:23:18,169
All right, good.


2464
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:23,349
The woman was charged with contributing to
the delinquency of a child and retail


2465
01:23:23,489 --> 01:23:23,949
theft.


2466
01:23:26,489 --> 01:23:29,809
Thank you, Detective Dale, for walking us
through these cases.


2467
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:33,949
These are indeed among the worst entitled
teens to have ever existed.


2468
01:23:33,989 --> 01:23:37,129
We just hope they learned their lesson and
step back on time.
