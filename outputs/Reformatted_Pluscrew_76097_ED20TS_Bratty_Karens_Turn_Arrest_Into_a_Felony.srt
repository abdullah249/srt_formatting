1
00:00:00,079 --> 00:00:03,459
Dude, you lie to my face one more [beep]
time, I'll sue you.


2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:04,699
Okay, I'm ready.


3
00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:08,899
Some people go through life never hearing the
word no and it shows.


4
00:00:08,899 --> 00:00:09,039
It's- it's the dog.


5
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:10,479
Property, you are going to go to jail.


6
00:00:10,479 --> 00:00:14,299
They grow up into full-blown Karens,
convinced the world revolves around them.


7
00:00:14,479 --> 00:00:15,579
So I'm gonna call my family.


8
00:00:15,579 --> 00:00:17,500
Well, no, you're not, you're not going
anywhere right now.


9
00:00:17,819 --> 00:00:17,840
Yeah. Yeah.


10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,619
Put your hands behind your back.


11
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:22,239
Hell, no. Hell, no. Hell, no.


12
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:24,899
I was going outside to get my card. [crying]


13
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,759
Turn around and face the wall.


14
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,380
Today, Detective Dale will take us through
five cases where Karens turned arrests into


15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,119
felonies.


16
00:00:33,259 --> 00:00:38,080
As law enforcement, some of my worst
experiences have been with entitled Karens


17
00:00:38,099 --> 00:00:42,299
who are absolutely convinced they're
incapable of doing anything wrong.


18
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,200
Entitlement really is nature's finest
blindfold, thicker than a nightshift worker's


19
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:52,099
blackout curtains, because here we have a
woman somehow blaming other cars for her


20
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,119
crime. What I see in your eyes indicate to me
that you have been consuming alcohol.


21
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:59,899
That's funny because you guys haven't done
anything of that nature to anybody else who's


22
00:00:59,939 --> 00:01:00,239
been hit.


23
00:01:00,459 --> 00:01:04,719
Officers were dispatched to a scene where a
car had been rear-ended a stop sign.


24
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,299
When they arrived, they were met by a woman
who immediately blamed other drivers for the


25
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,979
incident. She also demanded that those
drivers take a breathalyzer test while


26
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:16,039
refusing to cooperate herself.


27
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,759
Hey, can I talk to you down here, please?


28
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,619
Okay. Thank you so much. Okay.


29
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,999
Are these all your, are these all your bags?


30
00:01:24,999 --> 00:01:25,259
Yes.


31
00:01:25,279 --> 00:01:26,939
Oh, okay. We're just gonna go right here.


32
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:27,399
Okay.


33
00:01:27,639 --> 00:01:30,319
Hey, um, I know you told your story to those
officers already.


34
00:01:30,539 --> 00:01:33,639
Would you mind telling me again what, what
you remember happening?


35
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:38,219
I literally was at the, the stop sign right
here and got rear-ended. I was about to make


36
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:40,879
a left. So you were stopped in traffic, like,
gonna make a left here-


37
00:01:40,919 --> 00:01:40,939
Yeah


38
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:41,479
... on this street?


39
00:01:41,499 --> 00:01:42,379
Slammed into me.


40
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,739
Okay. Do you know which car hit you?


41
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,839
The car, like, I don't know what, uh... The
car in front here. Not this Kia.


42
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:49,759
The one in front.


43
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:50,519
The car in front of it?


44
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:50,699
Yeah.


45
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,879
Okay. And are you injured at all?


46
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,179
I don't... I feel like I'm, you know, like
just...


47
00:01:56,379 --> 00:01:57,119
You think you're worked up?


48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:57,679
Yeah.


49
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,059
Maybe?


50
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,659
Were you wearing your seatbelt?


51
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,619
I don't know. Yes, of course.


52
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:01,599
And did your airbags go off?


53
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:01,819
No.


54
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:02,539
Okay.


55
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:07,479
But I, I just... I don't know yet, but I'm, I
am shooken up and I


56
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:07,919
don't know.


57
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,839
Yeah. Well, at least you don't have any
physical injuries.


58
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:10,259
No, yeah.


59
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,599
I mean, you may, you may experience some pain
later, 'cause usually, you know, the shock of


60
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,459
a, an accident, maybe like tomorrow you might
feel some type of-


61
00:02:16,459 --> 00:02:20,839
And I've been in a wreck before that's been
my fault and shattered my arm with my airbag.


62
00:02:20,839 --> 00:02:22,879
So I kinda know that feeling, but-


63
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:23,459
Yeah


64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,319
... I feel like I'm just so angry right now,
because like I'm, I'm very grateful that


65
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,939
everybody's okay. But God forbid like a child
in the car or a baby, like-


66
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,159
Yeah


67
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,419
... I just don't know. And I'm just-


68
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,499
No, I totally understand. Yeah.


69
00:02:34,499 --> 00:02:34,839
So-


70
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,779
Did the fire department look at you when they
came out?


71
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:38,819
No, I d- I didn't sign anything.


72
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:42,319
Okay. You didn't need them to... You felt you
didn't need them to look at you or anything?


73
00:02:42,459 --> 00:02:43,599
No, they didn't offer it either.


74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:43,919
Okay.


75
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:44,459
So...


76
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:46,419
Okay. You don't feel you need to be checked
by them right now?


77
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:50,759
Not right now, no. I can't promise within the
next 24 hours I might feel that way, but


78
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:52,039
right now, no. I can't promise within the
next 24 hours I might feel that way, but
right now, no. I can't promise within the nex

99
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,019

That, that's different. You can always go see


100
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,659
your own doctor too. Right. Yeah. Or go to
the emergency room or whatever. Did he take a


101
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:50,439
breathalyzer? Who's that? The, the... I mean,
in my opinion, the driver that caused this.


102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,299
No. Well, so let me explain something to you.
Fir- first, um, with DUIs in the State of


103
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:51,559
Florida, um, we can't immediately administer
a breathalyzer to somebody. We have to


104
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:55,139
actually conduct an investigation beforehand.
Okay, so the officers that have, um, done


105
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,959
this traffic crash investigation, um, are
done with the investigation and they've


106
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,379
called me. I'm a DUI investigator, and
they're concerned maybe you have been


107
00:03:58,379 --> 00:03:58,539
drinking tonight, okay? Well, can't we just
do a breathalyzer? Well, like I said just a


108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,159
minute ago, it's, it's... That's not how it
works in Florida. Oh. We actually have to do


109
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,499
the investigation to determine whether or not
you were impaired first. Okay, but I honestly


110
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:01,959
feel like I... That's because I gave them a
hard time, so... And you know what, and if


111
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:04,819
that's the case, then you didn't give me a
hard time, so there, we, I don't have any ill


112
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:05,419
feelings about it. Okay. You know what I
mean? Like, it's not- I mean, I ju- I, I'm, I


113
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:07,099
feel very passionately about this and I would
never make... I just, I feel like I would


114
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,999
never make... I just, I feel like I would
never make that decision. I did have a- Yeah.


115
00:04:10,999 --> 00:04:12,699
I just, I feel like I would never make that
decision. I did have a- Yeah. I drank with my


116
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,719
coworker at 5:00 PM, but that was the last
drink I had. And I made a conscious effort-


117
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,959
So at, at five was the last time you had a
drink? ... at five. Yes. And how many drinks


118
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:16,979
did you have? Um... Two sangrias. Okay. And
that was it. And then we went shopping in


119
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,359
Hyde Park. Okay. And I was on my way home.
Okay. Okay. Um, the law tells me I have to


120
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,959
read you your rights. Okay. And I know for
some people that seems scary. The Miranda


121
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:26,379
rights? Go ahead. But it's, but it's not,
because it doesn't mean you're under arrest.


122
00:04:27,019 --> 00:04:27,559
Right. Okay. There's a lot of like, "Oh, I
saw this on TV and this means I'm under


123
00:04:28,499 --> 00:04:28,979
arrest." Not true. Okay. You're not under
arrest. Okay. Are you willing to answer


124
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,259
questions or make a statement without an
attorney being present? Uh, I don't know.


125
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:31,519
Listen, you can decide as you go if you want.
Okay.


126
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:33,779
I mean, you don't have to tell me yes or no
now. It's uh, totally up to you.


127
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:38,359
I'm trying to be as cooperative as possible,
but if I am injured, I don't want to...


128
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,299
I totally understand.


129
00:04:39,299 --> 00:04:39,539
Okay.


130
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:43,559
I totally understand. And I tell you what,
even to make you feel a little bit more


131
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:47,579
comfortable, I won't even ask you any
questions, okay? Just to circumvent this


132
00:04:47,739 --> 00:04:50,219
whole you're making a statement thing, okay?
But what I would like to do is just take a


133
00:04:50,239 --> 00:04:50,499
look at your eye, check your eyes. Sure.


134
00:04:50,499 --> 00:04:54,999
Okay? Um, now you already told me you're not,
you, you don't have any physical injuries.


135
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:58,219
You don't feel like you're severely injured
right now. Do you have any medical problems?


136
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:01,279
Taken any medications for anything?


137
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,419
Um, I take, I take antidepressants. I'm on
birth control. I'm on Adderall.


138
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:08,199
Any problems with your eyes?


139
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,759
No. I should wear glasses at night, but I'm
getting my prescription renewed, so...


140
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:17,259
If you're trying to quietly get away with a
crime, your best bet is to keep quiet.


141
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,679
Unless, of course, you want them to catch a
whiff of the sangria fumes leaking from your


142
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:26,759
pores. When the officer asked her to take a
field sobriety test, her reaction said it


143
00:05:26,779 --> 00:05:27,139
all.


144
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:30,639
Okay. I'm actually gonna have you stand right
over here and look at me this way, 'cause I


145
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:34,399
don't want you looking at traffic. Um, can
you put your feet together and then arms


146
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:39,259
straight down to your side? Now, I have to
shine a light towards your, towards your eyes


147
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:42,639
while I do this. I'm gonna try not gonna um,
I'm gonna try not to blind you. Can you move


148
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:43,139
your hair back? Yeah.


149
00:05:44,379 --> 00:05:45,519
All right. You see the red light here?


150
00:05:46,239 --> 00:05:49,759
What I want you to do is follow that red
light with your eyes, but keep your head


151
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:53,239
still. Okay, now I'm gonna move it back and
forth quite a few times. This, this takes a


152
00:05:53,239 --> 00:05:57,439
little while to do. If you have to blink,
that, that's totally fine. You can blink,


153
00:05:58,299 --> 00:06:01,579
okay? But just focus on the red light. Okay.
All right. Do, um, do you have other shoes in


154
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,699
the red light. Okay. All right. Do, um, do
you have other shoes in the vehicle with you


155
00:06:02,979 --> 00:06:03,299
or are those the only shoes that you have?
These are the only shoes I have. Okay.


156
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,539
There's a couple other exercises that I wanna
ask you to do, okay?


157
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:10,739
Uh, it's, it's, it's all part of the
standardized field sobriety exercises, okay?


158
00:06:10,739 --> 00:06:13,382
I just feel like I'm so nervous right now....


159
00:06:13,382 --> 00:06:14,341
this, uh, I feel like-


160
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:14,401
Right


161
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,401
... I didn't even cause this, and I'm the
one, like under scrutiny.


162
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:17,421
[siren wailing]


163
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:20,722
And you know what? And, and, and that may be
the case even if you didn't cause it.


164
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:21,021
Um,


165
00:06:22,122 --> 00:06:23,662
I, I feel where you're coming from


166
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:28,741
and I'm sorry you feel nervous. Whatever I
can do to help alleviate that, I will.


167
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:33,441
Um, but I do wanna to ask you to de- you
know, I would like you to perform the, the


168
00:06:33,742 --> 00:06:36,202
exercises. Um, those are pretty big heels so,
um,


169
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:41,921
I'll give you the option. You can, if you
feel very, very comfortable walking in those,


170
00:06:41,922 --> 00:06:43,901
you the option. You can, if you feel very,
very comfortable walking in those, you can


171
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:44,602
listen to my instructions and decide whether
or not- No, because I feel like that's-


172
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:45,662
... you want to do it with or without them
on.


173
00:06:46,742 --> 00:06:47,221
I just, can I, like do I have to do this
right now?


174
00:06:47,221 --> 00:06:49,702
You like our videos? Don't forget to
subscribe.


175
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:51,702
Well, there's no penalty for refusing them.


176
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:56,422
But I have to tell you, if you refuse to do
the field sobriety exercises, you force me to


177
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,561
make a decision either to arrest you or not
arrest you, based on what I've seen so far.


178
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:02,161
Okay. I want to talk to my family. [sniffs]


179
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:05,261
Well, making a phone call right now is not an
option, okay? This is... You're an adult.


180
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:06,721
This is a decision that you have to make.


181
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:06,961
No.


182
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:10,582
I will, I will talk to you and explain
everything to you that you want to know-


183
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:10,701
This-


184
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:12,062
... as far as the law is concerned.


185
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,061
That's... I didn't cause this.


186
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,281
Well, that doesn't matter. And the, it-


187
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:20,121
It does because I feel like I'm being, I'm
being put in a position right now to


188
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:23,042
prove something that I didn't, I didn't
create.


189
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:26,821
Well, I'm not saying that you, you caused the
accident at all. Th- I'm not saying that.


190
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,841
I'm not accusing you of causing the accident,
no.


191
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,321
And you're not-


192
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:29,442
But-


193
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,241
... letting me call my family and ask-


194
00:07:31,241 --> 00:07:31,261
But-


195
00:07:31,261 --> 00:07:32,901
... them what I should do right now?


196
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:33,202
But listen-


197
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,821
With or without a lawyer present?


198
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,241
Listen, listen to what, listen to what I'm s-


199
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,142
I'm asking no. Yes or no?


200
00:07:37,362 --> 00:07:38,981
Yeah, I don't want you to call your family
right now, no.


201
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:39,361
Why?


202
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,981
No. Because I'm in the middle of an
investigation, okay?


203
00:07:42,241 --> 00:07:42,261
But-


204
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,761
And you're an adult. You can make your own
decisions, okay?


205
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,182
Yeah, I don't care. I'm, I'm telling you
what's gonna accommodate my needs to make me


206
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:48,381
feel most comfortable.


207
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,181
Well, unfortunately, that's not an option
right now.


208
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:52,742
Okay, let me explain to you again where I'm
coming from, okay?


209
00:07:53,161 --> 00:07:58,122
And, and, uh, this is, this is my
observations on you so far, is, uh, I can


210
00:07:58,141 --> 00:07:58,661
smell alcohol.


211
00:07:59,782 --> 00:08:02,001
Um, you have watery, bloodshot eyes.


212
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:02,861
You're-


213
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,681
Yeah, because I'm about to start crying.


214
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:04,721
[traffic rumbling]


215
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:09,861
Your speech is slurred, okay? And, and what I
see in your eyes indicate to me


216
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:10,581
that you have been consuming alcohol.


217
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:15,561
That's funny because you guys haven't done
anything of that nature to anybody else who's


218
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,361
been hit. I haven't seen you run a sobriety
test on me.


219
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:18,381
Well-


220
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,481
So I'm gonna call my family.


221
00:08:19,501 --> 00:08:21,361
Well, no, you're not, you're not going
anywhere right now.


222
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:21,381
Yeah.


223
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:22,301
Okay? Come here.


224
00:08:22,801 --> 00:08:22,821
No.


225
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:23,601
Put your hands behind your back.


226
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:28,421
No, no, no, no, stop. Why are you doing


227
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:28,841
that?


228
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,141
Put your hands-


229
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:30,141
Why are you doing that?


230
00:08:30,241 --> 00:08:31,241
Stop her. Stop her.


231
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:32,341
Why are you doing that?


232
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:33,441
Don't touch me.


233
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:33,621
Don't touch her.


234
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:35,161
Why are you doing that?


235
00:08:35,741 --> 00:08:35,761
Get up, get up, get up.


236
00:08:35,761 --> 00:08:36,901
Why are you doing that?


237
00:08:36,961 --> 00:08:36,981
Stop. Hey.


238
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:37,981
Stop. Stop.


239
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:39,081
Because I can't call my family.


240
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:40,181
Grab, grab her right arm. Grab her right arm.


241
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:41,281
Come on.


242
00:08:41,381 --> 00:08:42,381
I can't call my family?


243
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,481
And hold that.


244
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:44,581
Grab her right arm.


245
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:45,681
I can't call my family? [handcuffs clinking]


246
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:46,781
Calm down. Calm down, please.


247
00:08:46,881 --> 00:08:47,881
Where? I can't call my family?


248
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:48,981
Calm down. Calm down.


249
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,081
I'm calling for you. I'm coming for you.


250
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:51,181
Hey.


251
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,261
I can't call my family?


252
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:55,001
Come on, the... You're under arrest. [system
beeping] Will you grab, someone grab her


253
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:55,521
phone? Yes, I got it. I, it's here.


254
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:58,521
Why would you not let me call my family?
That's not an option right now.


255
00:08:58,521 --> 00:08:59,741
Why? Why?


256
00:09:00,161 --> 00:09:00,321
Because I said so.


257
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:03,501
Yeah, my brother's at ATF and he's been on
the phone the whole fucking time.


258
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:04,081
That's fine. [handcuffs clinking]


259
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:07,781
Yeah, it is fine. And you know what? What you
did was not fine.


260
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:09,661
You wouldn't let me call my family-


261
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:09,801
Okay


262
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:10,801
... and that's not okay.


263
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,361
Let me lock these cuffs before we get in.


264
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:13,741
Okay, good.


265
00:09:13,741 --> 00:09:14,741
Good.


266
00:09:14,841 --> 00:09:18,221
I didn't fucking do anything. This person who
caused this wreck.


267
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:19,841
This should be open.


268
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:22,981
Put your head... Okay, let me see.


269
00:09:27,521 --> 00:09:28,521
Who got her, who's got her phone?


270
00:09:28,581 --> 00:09:28,941
I got it.


271
00:09:30,761 --> 00:09:31,101
This is all her stuff.


272
00:09:31,101 --> 00:09:32,141
This is all her stuff? Because someone
stepped up to you.


273
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:36,361
She took something and she took like a... I
don't know what it was.


274
00:09:37,021 --> 00:09:37,661
A large bottle of wine.


275
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,861
Some kind of liquid.


276
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,581
It was under... This is his air bag.


277
00:09:41,601 --> 00:09:42,761
Large bottle of champagne.


278
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:45,261
Did she call for an ambulance? Yes. Yes.


279
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:45,421
How


280
00:09:46,081 --> 00:09:46,301
come?


281
00:09:46,501 --> 00:09:47,781
Because she was driving and we were looking
for the-


282
00:09:47,781 --> 00:09:48,961
Ma'am, ma'am.


283
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,781
Hey guys, let's not, let's not argue about
it.


284
00:09:50,781 --> 00:09:51,181
It doesn't-


285
00:09:51,401 --> 00:09:52,061
No, no, we're not arguing.


286
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:52,141
She was driving.


287
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,521
Cause of the crash doesn't matter.


288
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,241
Shut the fuck up.


289
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:55,821
You fucking bum.


290
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:56,421
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.


291
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,981
That's enough. Get away, buddy.


292
00:09:57,981 --> 00:09:58,541
We gonna go down there for a reason.


293
00:09:58,541 --> 00:09:59,461
Time to leave.


294
00:09:59,461 --> 00:10:00,001
Go ahead. No, you two go.


295
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,481
Hey, you're, you're, you're gonna end up...


296
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,181
Yes, ma'am. I'm talking to you. Yes, ma'am.
Sorry.


297
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,241
If she had


298
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:21,261
even the slightest clue how the law works,
she would have just taken


299
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:25,541
the sobriety test and walked off with a nice,
neat DUI.


300
00:10:25,601 --> 00:10:28,361
Instead, she chose the scenic route to
disaster.


301
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:33,401
It wasn't until officers explained what
refusing a breath test actually meant that it


302
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,621
finally hit her how royally she'd messed up.


303
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:38,801
Just take a peek in there, see if you see any
like, containers or anything.


304
00:10:38,881 --> 00:10:42,861
No, she said she dumped this cup right there.
She said she dumped this cup.


305
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:43,861
What cu- where's the cup?


306
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,501
The white cup over there. She said she dumped
it.


307
00:10:45,501 --> 00:10:46,221
She dumped that out?


308
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:49,061
Okay, there's a pen, like a THC pen


309
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,241
right here as well.


310
00:10:52,281 --> 00:10:54,041
It could explain her dilated pupils,


311
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:55,021
sure.


312
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:55,961
Right there.


313
00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:57,881
See it?


314
00:10:58,261 --> 00:10:58,681
Yeah.


315
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,801
It could be, I don't know. It could be vape.
Who knows?


316
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:03,061
Yeah.


317
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:05,801
And not... Just leave it. All right.


318
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,261
Hey, who was driving the silver Ford?


319
00:11:08,481 --> 00:11:09,221
Oh, that's mine.


320
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,321
You were driving?


321
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:11,381
Um,


322
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:13,681
you injured at all?


323
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,501
Are you injured at all?


324
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:19,261
I don't know. I'm just really nervous. Like,
I just can't stop shaking.


325
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:19,881
Okay.


326
00:11:19,901 --> 00:11:21,281
Did he FaceTime me or didn't FaceTime him?


327
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:21,841
Was she in the car with you?


328
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:23,141
No, this is my mom.


329
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,201
Was anybody in the car with you?


330
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:27,141
Um, it was two people were in the car with
me, but they left.


331
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,161
Were they injured at all?


332
00:11:28,181 --> 00:11:29,141
Um, they weren't injured.


333
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:30,181
Okay.


334
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:30,261
Hey, hey.


335
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:30,901
Did he FaceTime me?


336
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:31,301
Thank you.


337
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:33,201
And do you know where her purse


338
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,101
is?


339
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:38,561
I took the, uh... No, he can have it. I to- I
took credit card out of it. Were you injured


340
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:41,361
at all? So I got a, uh, got a burn here.


341
00:11:42,141 --> 00:11:43,541
Burn from this, uh, airbag?


342
00:11:43,701 --> 00:11:43,961
Yeah.


343
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:45,601
Airbag burn? The seatbelt mark? Okay.


344
00:11:45,601 --> 00:11:46,501
I got burned here.


345
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:49,601
My neck is a little bit hurt, but it's not a
big deal.


346
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:50,261
Just your neck?


347
00:11:50,481 --> 00:11:50,781
Yeah.


348
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,141
Okay, we're out of here. Huh?


349
00:11:53,261 --> 00:11:54,821
You got hers and his email?


350
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:56,181
I got hers. Yeah, we got it. We got
everything. We can go.


351
00:11:56,181 --> 00:12:05,181
[door opening]


352
00:12:05,181 --> 00:12:08,321
We're going down to the jail. I'm gonna ask
you to do a breath test. Are you willing to


353
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:08,741
do a breath test. Are you willing to do that?
No.


354
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:12,761
Okay. [system beeping] . Now I have to read
you something since you said you don't want


355
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,901
to read you something since you said you
don't want to take the breath test, okay? It


356
00:12:16,501 --> 00:12:17,081
involves what happens to your driver's
license. I'm Officer ******.


357
00:12:17,747 --> 00:12:21,927
... department. I am now requesting that you
submit to a lawful test of your breath, for


358
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:24,967
the purpose of determining its alcohol
content. Will you take the test I'm


359
00:12:25,108 --> 00:12:25,307
requesting? No.


360
00:12:25,587 --> 00:12:30,168
Okay. If you refuse to take the test I have
requested of you, your driving privilege will


361
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:34,888
be suspended for a period of one year for a
first refusal or 18 months [beeping] if your


362
00:12:34,928 --> 00:12:39,428
driving privilege has been previously
suspended, or if you have been previously


363
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:44,208
fined under Florida Statute 327.35215, for


364
00:12:44,247 --> 00:12:47,188
refusing to submit to a lawful test of your
breath, urine, or blood.


365
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:48,867
Do you understand what I've just read to you?


366
00:12:48,967 --> 00:12:50,208
No, I want a lawyer present.


367
00:12:51,107 --> 00:12:52,627
Okay, do you understand what I just read to
you?


368
00:12:52,627 --> 00:12:52,848
No.


369
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:54,027
What do you not understand?


370
00:12:54,147 --> 00:12:56,907
All of it. I want a lawyer present for all of
this.


371
00:12:57,267 --> 00:12:59,108
I understand, and I'll- I'll get to that in
just a second.


372
00:12:59,147 --> 00:12:59,647
But I-


373
00:12:59,688 --> 00:13:01,767
No, I don't understand it. And I want a
lawyer present.


374
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:03,207
Well, explain to me what you don't
understand.


375
00:13:03,207 --> 00:13:06,228
All of it, and I want a lawyer present, point
blank, period.


376
00:13:06,247 --> 00:13:09,227
Okay, that's fine. And you'll be able to call
your lawyer here in a minute.


377
00:13:09,227 --> 00:13:12,208
But I need to make sure you understand what I
just read to you.


378
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:17,127
No, I don't understand it, because I should
not be in the backseat of a car right now or


379
00:13:17,127 --> 00:13:19,227
arrested for wanting to talk to a member of
my family.


380
00:13:19,228 --> 00:13:20,887
That has nothing to do with you under-


381
00:13:21,128 --> 00:13:21,547
I want my attorney.


382
00:13:21,688 --> 00:13:23,547
That has nothing to do with you
understanding-


383
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:24,007
I want my attorney.


384
00:13:24,007 --> 00:13:26,268
... has nothing to do with you understanding
what I just read.


385
00:13:26,387 --> 00:13:27,427
I don't understand it.


386
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:28,507
Do you want me to read it again?


387
00:13:28,588 --> 00:13:28,947
Nope.


388
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:30,867
I want an attorney present.


389
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:35,647
So what this is saying is if you refuse the
breath test, your license is going to be


390
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:36,028
suspended for one year.


391
00:13:36,168 --> 00:13:37,667
Okay, and I'm gonna challenge that.


392
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:38,608
Do you understand that?


393
00:13:38,707 --> 00:13:38,987
Nope.


394
00:13:39,047 --> 00:13:41,467
You don't understand that your license is
gonna be suspended for one year?


395
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:41,588
Nope.


396
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:41,967
Why not?


397
00:13:42,248 --> 00:13:44,108
Because I didn't do anything wrong.


398
00:13:44,387 --> 00:13:48,447
Okay, th- that can be your defense, that's
fine. What I'm telling you is...


399
00:13:48,788 --> 00:13:49,187
You're saying-


400
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:50,007
... what the law is.


401
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,588
You're not saying it's an, immediately, that
is what is


402
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:59,467
going to an effect. That is a chance that I'm
willing to take if I'm not taking...


403
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:04,748
Um, that's not how it works. What happens is
if you refuse the breath test, um, your


404
00:14:04,748 --> 00:14:06,048
license gets [beeping] suspended immediately.


405
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:07,107
Why?


406
00:14:07,428 --> 00:14:08,588
Because that's what the law is.


407
00:14:08,928 --> 00:14:10,887
That's weird, 'cause, you know-


408
00:14:10,887 --> 00:14:13,207
I didn't, I didn't make the law. I'm just
telling you what it is.


409
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:17,227
Yeah, I actually know the law though, and my
boyfriend, that didn't happen to him, so


410
00:14:18,027 --> 00:14:18,527
that's fine.


411
00:14:18,627 --> 00:14:21,207
So you understand it's going to be suspended
for a year if you don't take the breath test?


412
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,807
No, I'm not accepting that.


413
00:14:22,807 --> 00:14:23,107
Why not?


414
00:14:23,107 --> 00:14:26,127
And I want my attorney present, point blank,
period.


415
00:14:27,267 --> 00:14:27,747
That's it.


416
00:14:28,387 --> 00:14:29,267
Okay, let's step out.


417
00:14:32,227 --> 00:14:35,307
Do you have everything on you? Anything on
you that can possibly stick to me, anything


418
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:35,987
like that? I got a patch up.


419
00:14:35,987 --> 00:14:36,307
Yeah.


420
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:41,127
Nothing hidden in your bra, nothing like
that?


421
00:14:46,307 --> 00:14:46,687
All right.


422
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,007
Hold on, I just need to go that way.


423
00:14:52,827 --> 00:14:56,367
She was charged with DUI and resisting
arrest.


424
00:14:56,407 --> 00:15:01,367
As entitled as this woman was, she was still
sober enough to navigate the situation.


425
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:04,087
Our next suspect, yeah, she needed a sitter.


426
00:15:05,087 --> 00:15:05,747
Whoa!


427
00:15:06,787 --> 00:15:08,067
Why are you taking me to jail?


428
00:15:08,267 --> 00:15:12,887
Entitlement is a sickness. And when you mix
it with alcohol and a warped sense of


429
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:17,807
superiority, it turns into a full-blown
disaster, not just for the culprit,


430
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:20,727
but for the poor cops caught in the
crossfire.


431
00:15:21,207 --> 00:15:22,527
Why is it on your vest?


432
00:15:22,687 --> 00:15:24,367
Because I took your ID to run you.


433
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:26,387
Because you like me. Honey, I'll never do
you.


434
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:30,327
You got a -ing kid on the top of your head.
That's a bad spot.


435
00:15:30,447 --> 00:15:35,187
On December 25th, 2023, officers were called
to a hotel


436
00:15:35,307 --> 00:15:39,127
after a woman refused to leave her room well
past checkout.


437
00:15:39,187 --> 00:15:43,167
When they knocked, she ignored them
completely, refusing to open the door.


438
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:46,927
And when she finally did speak up, the
officers probably wished she hadn't.


439
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:50,747
Um, he was supposed to have been gone by
12:00, it's now 2:00.


440
00:15:50,827 --> 00:15:51,067
Okay.


441
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:54,327
And he just called and was saying some very
inappropriate things to me.


442
00:15:55,107 --> 00:15:57,887
Um, as far as I know, he's still in the room.


443
00:15:57,987 --> 00:16:00,587
I don't know, but I'd like him to be gone.


444
00:16:00,707 --> 00:16:02,127
Would you like him trespassed from the
property?


445
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:02,947
Yes.


446
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:03,267
Okay.


447
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:03,707
I mean...


448
00:16:03,727 --> 00:16:04,947
You mind coming up with us?


449
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,347
Not today. Yeah, I can come down.


450
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:07,167
Okay.


451
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,587
What was he saying when he called?


452
00:16:08,887 --> 00:16:12,927
Um, probably would've put a bag over my head.
He was gonna make me naked.


453
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,387
That's not very nice.


454
00:16:14,567 --> 00:16:14,887
No.


455
00:16:14,927 --> 00:16:18,047
Could you stand over here, please? [knocking]


456
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:20,247
Who do you want?


457
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:22,287
Police. Come to the door, please.


458
00:16:22,687 --> 00:16:23,447
I can't.


459
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:27,547
Why can't you? Are you okay right now,
physically?


460
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:28,307
What?


461
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:31,607
Are you physically okay? Can you come to the
door, please?


462
00:16:31,647 --> 00:16:31,887
What?


463
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,487
Can you come to the door, please?


464
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:35,267
No, I can't. Take it off.


465
00:16:35,727 --> 00:16:38,467
Okay. Well, if you don't come to the door,
I'm going to open the door.


466
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,267
Hey, she'll kill you.


467
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,347
Well, where is your dog?


468
00:16:41,527 --> 00:16:45,067
Right here. I put a leash on so she doesn't
tear up your flat, ass.


469
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:47,347
All right. Please do put a leash on the dog.


470
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:48,227
Are you black or white?


471
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,207
I don't see the relevance.


472
00:16:50,527 --> 00:16:52,207
I do. My dog will lick you.


473
00:16:52,607 --> 00:16:53,047
Okay.


474
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,107
Yes.


475
00:16:54,647 --> 00:16:55,887
Is your dog on a leash now?


476
00:16:56,007 --> 00:16:56,927
No, not yet.


477
00:16:57,247 --> 00:16:58,707
I want you to open the door right now.


478
00:16:58,927 --> 00:16:59,527
Well, why?


479
00:16:59,847 --> 00:17:00,887
So that I can talk to you.


480
00:17:01,247 --> 00:17:03,087
You can talk to me through the door. We'll go
in there.


481
00:17:03,087 --> 00:17:05,407
If you don't open the door, I'm going to open
the door.


482
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:06,647
Whatever.


483
00:17:07,447 --> 00:17:09,067
I'll just sit here, wait for you.


484
00:17:15,627 --> 00:17:17,467
Don't you try to do anything. You got a key,
right?


485
00:17:17,607 --> 00:17:19,167
I do. Come unlock the door, please.


486
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:19,867
Nope.


487
00:17:19,867 --> 00:17:21,047
Please come unlock the door.


488
00:17:21,347 --> 00:17:24,407
No. It's Christmas. You're scaring me,
mother-


489
00:17:25,147 --> 00:17:28,467
Well, I'm sorry that you're afraid. I'm not
trying to scare you. Please come to the door.


490
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:30,367
You better go, or I'll call home.


491
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,467
Get your ass in front of this.


492
00:17:33,087 --> 00:17:34,607
Where are you? I can't see you.


493
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:35,487
Where are you?


494
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:36,447
You ain't white.


495
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:37,647
I'm concerned.


496
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:38,467
Why?


497
00:17:38,487 --> 00:17:40,427
Can you please open the door so I can talk to
you?


498
00:17:41,007 --> 00:17:41,327
Hey.


499
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:43,687
Harold.


500
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:47,027
I know your name is Harold or something like
that.


501
00:17:47,387 --> 00:17:49,207
Okay. My name is Corporal Harris, actually.


502
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:49,227
Harold.


503
00:17:49,227 --> 00:17:50,747
Can you please unlock, open the door?


504
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:52,827
No. Merry Christmas. Leave me alone.


505
00:17:53,147 --> 00:17:56,407
Okay, listen, if you don't open that door,
I'm going to come in there.


506
00:17:56,407 --> 00:17:58,487
And when I come in there, I'm going to take
you to jail.


507
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:02,007
Okay. I'll wait for you. Why are you coming
to my room?


508
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:03,907
Whoa!


509
00:18:04,887 --> 00:18:06,227
Why are you taking me to jail?


510
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:10,547
Jams 20b.


511
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:13,227
Hold on, baby. It's okay.


512
00:18:13,307 --> 00:18:14,747
Hey, puppy. Hey, puppy.


513
00:18:14,907 --> 00:18:17,467
Nope. Nope. She's my service dog. That's too
tight.


514
00:18:18,167 --> 00:18:19,207
That's too tight.


515
00:18:21,117 --> 00:18:22,577
I'm telling you, it's too tight.


516
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:23,397
I understand that.


517
00:18:23,597 --> 00:18:24,797
Okay, then loosen it.


518
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:27,177
My fingers fit inside of it.


519
00:18:27,177 --> 00:18:30,817
Hold on, loosen the fucking cuffs. Loosen
them or I'll fart all over you.


520
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:34,138
Okay, you're gonna have to pay for this,
brother. You know that, right?


521
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:34,537
What?


522
00:18:34,637 --> 00:18:36,617
Harris. [police radio]


523
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:39,217
Corporal Harris, walk with me, please. We're
going over there.


524
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:39,898
Take your hand off. Take your fat hands off.


525
00:18:39,898 --> 00:18:41,617
We're going over there to have a seat. Come
with me.


526
00:18:41,977 --> 00:18:43,318
I can't 'cause you won't... How am I gonna
move?


527
00:18:43,318 --> 00:18:46,557
Okay, I can bring you over there. You can
stand up and we can walk now.


528
00:18:46,557 --> 00:18:46,958
How am I gonna move?


529
00:18:47,017 --> 00:18:47,398
Come on.


530
00:18:47,937 --> 00:18:49,997
Does this help? Stay here.


531
00:18:50,617 --> 00:18:51,837
Come here. Don't touch that.


532
00:18:52,677 --> 00:18:53,218
Hey, puppy. Have a seat, please.


533
00:18:53,218 --> 00:18:57,738
Let me sit over here. Come here. Don't touch
my dog. It's the law. It's a federal fucking


534
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,717
law. It's a federal fucking law. Sit down,
please. Please sit down.


535
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:01,017
Don't you fuckin' touch my fucking dog.


536
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:02,357
Okay, is there a reason-


537
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:02,378
Ah, ah


538
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,217
... why you're still in here?


539
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:07,457
Billy, come here. Sit down. You fucking
bastard, don't sit down.


540
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:08,358
Where's your ID at?


541
00:19:09,477 --> 00:19:10,977
It's on the bed you fucking pig. No.


542
00:19:10,977 --> 00:19:11,378
Hey, puppy.


543
00:19:11,378 --> 00:19:11,998
Sit down.


544
00:19:12,997 --> 00:19:14,337
Keep her on, wait for a second.


545
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:15,697
Right now. Don't touch my dog.


546
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:18,618
Who are you?


547
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:22,477
Prince? You're a detective.


548
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:25,837
7:55 to base. Can you run a 27 for me?


549
00:19:26,317 --> 00:19:26,737
Hello?


550
00:19:28,397 --> 00:19:30,117
Tell me who was trespassing and why.


551
00:19:30,538 --> 00:19:32,017
We asked you to go and you didn't.


552
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:33,117
Who asked me to go?


553
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:34,557
This is trafficking report.


554
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:36,577
Who... Lieutenant.


555
00:19:36,777 --> 00:19:37,197
10-4 Florida.


556
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:37,537
10-4 Florida.


557
00:19:37,878 --> 00:19:39,297
Lieutenant, look at me, sir.


558
00:19:40,218 --> 00:19:41,357
Who asked me to go?


559
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,957
I don't... Who asked me to leave?


560
00:19:44,477 --> 00:19:46,918
The hotel, and then we came to talk to you
and you didn't want to talk to us.


561
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:50,257
No, I didn't want to talk to you. Of course,
it's Christmas. Why would I want to talk to


562
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:50,878
you? Yeah.


563
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:53,297
And the hotel did not. I just checked out.


564
00:19:53,498 --> 00:19:54,897
If you checked out, why are you here?


565
00:19:55,158 --> 00:19:56,418
Because... [laughs]


566
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,477
Uh, 'cause you guys came and fucking
handcuffed me.


567
00:19:59,697 --> 00:19:59,818
Yeah.


568
00:19:59,857 --> 00:20:01,758
I was leaving, so what's the problem?


569
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:03,017
Miss Umbarto, are you from here?


570
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:07,237
No. Well, do you think I'm from here? You saw
my license. What's the address, sir?


571
00:20:07,237 --> 00:20:10,677
I did see your license. It's very common to
have licenses that are from other states.


572
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:12,798
And it's none of your business. My address is
what's on that fucking card.


573
00:20:13,097 --> 00:20:16,357
All I'm trying to ask is 'cause I'm trying to
find out if somebody can come get your dog or


574
00:20:16,357 --> 00:20:17,897
if somebody can come get your dog or if I'm
calling animal control. If you don't want to


575
00:20:17,897 --> 00:20:18,377
work with me- You can't do that


576
00:20:18,377 --> 00:20:18,737
... I'll call animal control.


577
00:20:18,737 --> 00:20:19,297
You don't know the law.


578
00:20:19,337 --> 00:20:19,997
I can do that.


579
00:20:20,097 --> 00:20:21,837
Okay, whatever. Call the cops.


580
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:22,357
Yes, ma'am.


581
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:23,937
Get your fucking boss down here, brother.


582
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:24,957
This is my boss.


583
00:20:25,677 --> 00:20:28,517
Then you know the law. You know you can't
take this dog from me.


584
00:20:28,637 --> 00:20:30,637
The jail's not going to accept your W.


585
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:31,917
I'm not going to jail.


586
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:32,997
You are going to jail.


587
00:20:33,057 --> 00:20:33,097
Yes, you are.


588
00:20:33,097 --> 00:20:35,117
Okay, I got friends there so


589
00:20:35,797 --> 00:20:37,317
who do I do on to the van?


590
00:20:37,477 --> 00:20:42,257
If the cops weren't already convinced she was
either unstable or drunk, her behavior


591
00:20:42,397 --> 00:20:47,357
seals the deal. Due to her condition, the
officers continued to display patience, but


592
00:20:47,377 --> 00:20:49,677
it was becoming exceedingly difficult.


593
00:20:49,677 --> 00:20:54,477
When the woman finally stops barking orders
at the officers like they're her personal


594
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:57,877
bellboys, they lay out two simple options.


595
00:20:58,077 --> 00:21:02,697
Let us forgive these motherfuckers
trespassing assholes who trespass against


596
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:03,077
us.


597
00:21:03,797 --> 00:21:08,757
They don't have to be Black. They can be
white, pink and purple. They still fucking


598
00:21:09,677 --> 00:21:13,197
suck cock. Start over. Father, who art in
heaven. Thank you, my brother.


599
00:21:13,937 --> 00:21:16,937
Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come,


600
00:21:17,597 --> 00:21:22,397
thy will be done. You'll be done,
motherfucker, as it is in heaven.


601
00:21:22,577 --> 00:21:24,337
Undo the fucking cuffs.


602
00:21:25,457 --> 00:21:28,857
Father, who art in heaven, hallowed by thy
name.


603
00:21:29,157 --> 00:21:30,177
Thy kingdom come,


604
00:21:30,897 --> 00:21:34,037
they will be done. Give us this day our daily
bread.


605
00:21:34,057 --> 00:21:38,777
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive these
fucking idiot trespassed against


606
00:21:38,777 --> 00:21:39,137
us.


607
00:21:39,577 --> 00:21:40,617
I'm gonna call my number on this.


608
00:21:40,617 --> 00:21:42,677
Start over. Father-


609
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,657
She calling, she called me.


610
00:21:43,657 --> 00:21:44,497
... who art in heaven.


611
00:21:44,497 --> 00:21:44,997
Can't touch this. It's like five or six.


612
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:49,957
Hallowed by thy name. Thy kingdom come, they
will be done on earth. Father.


613
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:54,037
Blacks, whites, Jews.


614
00:21:54,677 --> 00:21:55,837
Hallowed by thy name.


615
00:21:56,837 --> 00:22:01,517
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth,
this fucking


616
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:05,777
Earth, Mother Earth, as it is in heaven. This
is what I tell you here.


617
00:22:06,037 --> 00:22:06,557
All right, ma'am.


618
00:22:06,737 --> 00:22:09,297
I'm not talking to him. You're the boss man.


619
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:09,697
Ma'am.


620
00:22:09,697 --> 00:22:10,597
He's a peon. Shut up.


621
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:14,217
I'm gonna explain something to you, and if
you don't like it you don't have to like it,


622
00:22:14,217 --> 00:22:15,537
but you need to hear it. Okay. Hold on. Let
me, let me


623
00:22:16,197 --> 00:22:17,477
pray for your fucking ass real quick.


624
00:22:17,497 --> 00:22:19,117
Okay. What I'm about to tell you-


625
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:19,257
Shut up


626
00:22:19,257 --> 00:22:22,437
... is the difference between whether your
dog goes to animal control or whether you get


627
00:22:22,497 --> 00:22:22,697
to animal control or whether you get to keep
your dog, okay?


628
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:23,117
Okay.


629
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,377
So I suggest you pay attention.


630
00:22:24,537 --> 00:22:29,397
Hold on. I got to concentrate. Remember, I'm
100% veteran.


631
00:22:30,097 --> 00:22:30,597
United States


632
00:22:31,237 --> 00:22:32,317
Air Force, motherfucker.


633
00:22:33,557 --> 00:22:33,857
Ma'am.


634
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:34,257
Ah.


635
00:22:34,317 --> 00:22:35,577
You're smacked down with three mil-


636
00:22:35,577 --> 00:22:35,597
Hold on. Ah.


637
00:22:35,597 --> 00:22:36,617
Three military bases.


638
00:22:36,617 --> 00:22:36,737
I gotta, I gotta-


639
00:22:36,737 --> 00:22:37,957
You can't throw a rock without hitting-


640
00:22:37,957 --> 00:22:38,957
... focus.


641
00:22:40,157 --> 00:22:43,897
I've been trained by the United States
Government. You haven't.


642
00:22:44,177 --> 00:22:45,097
Don't touch my fucking


643
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:46,657
jacket,


644
00:22:47,397 --> 00:22:49,657
you pervert. You just fucked up my bag.
That's another one.


645
00:22:50,117 --> 00:22:54,577
You can't even fish 'cause you have shitty
shoes. You definitely have an AR-15.


646
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:59,197
You kinda got one, but you don't know how to
use it. You got a plate holding your dick up.


647
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,357
Uh, badge, gun. And why is your gun
unhostered?


648
00:23:03,457 --> 00:23:05,457
Why is his gun unhostered, motherfucker?


649
00:23:05,577 --> 00:23:09,797
Bobby, Fabby, police, his gun is unhostered.


650
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,057
Okay, you gonna listen to what he has to say?


651
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,197
No, I wanna know why his gun's unhostered.


652
00:23:14,337 --> 00:23:15,517
What makes you think it's unhostered?


653
00:23:15,517 --> 00:23:18,437
Because I... I can tell you, fucking moron,
marksman sp-


654
00:23:19,077 --> 00:23:20,097
gun specialist.


655
00:23:20,377 --> 00:23:20,577
Well, that's good.


656
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,137
Now, fucking put that thing back on before
you talk to me.


657
00:23:23,437 --> 00:23:24,517
All right. So-


658
00:23:24,517 --> 00:23:24,997
I'm talking to you.


659
00:23:24,997 --> 00:23:28,097
... I'm gonna give you one more chance and
then I'm gonna call animal control and send


660
00:23:28,157 --> 00:23:28,537
your dog to animal control.


661
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:29,257
All right. Well-


662
00:23:29,257 --> 00:23:31,417
I've called the jail and they won't take the
dog.


663
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:33,297
I knew they wouldn't. It's Christmas.


664
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:35,937
They won't, but what they will do is ROR you
for some misdemeanors.


665
00:23:35,937 --> 00:23:36,697
What does that mean?


666
00:23:36,777 --> 00:23:38,557
That means that you're not gonna be held on
bail.


667
00:23:38,557 --> 00:23:38,577
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


668
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,617
They're going to process you and let you out
the front door.


669
00:23:41,517 --> 00:23:42,657
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.


670
00:23:42,677 --> 00:23:44,637
Now, if you cooperate with me and cooperate
with them-


671
00:23:44,637 --> 00:23:45,277
I don't know what a WOR is.


672
00:23:45,277 --> 00:23:47,297
... I'll hold your dog till you come out the
front door.


673
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,477
You can have your dog back and we'll all go
on about our day.


674
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:49,977
I don't know what the fuck a WOR means.


675
00:23:49,977 --> 00:23:53,077
And if you don't want to cooperate, release
on own recognizance.


676
00:23:53,077 --> 00:23:56,157
It means they're gonna release you without
you having to go see a judge.


677
00:23:56,237 --> 00:23:58,197
But I still haven't heard my rights yet.


678
00:23:58,577 --> 00:23:58,597
Okay.


679
00:23:58,597 --> 00:23:59,557
I'm under arrest.


680
00:23:59,557 --> 00:24:00,677
Well, that's irrelevant.


681
00:24:00,817 --> 00:24:01,517
No, it's not.


682
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:05,817
But do you want the dog to go to animal
control or would you like-


683
00:24:05,817 --> 00:24:09,657
Well, you know the answer. We both know the
answers. Do I really have to answer you?


684
00:24:10,277 --> 00:24:11,557
No. No, I do not want the dog.


685
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:16,517
Okay, so what we can do is if you cooperate,
once you get to the jail, they're going to


686
00:24:16,577 --> 00:24:18,477
let you out on your own recognizance, which
means-


687
00:24:18,557 --> 00:24:18,937
Good, let's go


688
00:24:18,937 --> 00:24:20,177
... you don't have to see a judge, but-


689
00:24:20,197 --> 00:24:20,857
We can take-


690
00:24:20,857 --> 00:24:21,377
... you have to cooperate.


691
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,697
Can you undo these cuffs?


692
00:24:22,937 --> 00:24:24,337
Cannot do that till we get to the jail.


693
00:24:24,357 --> 00:24:26,597
Can you loosen them? Can you get me some
water?


694
00:24:26,737 --> 00:24:27,137
Not right now.


695
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:30,432
Can you re- read me my rights? Can you put my
fucking handcuffs-... shoes on.


696
00:24:30,491 --> 00:24:31,671
We'll let you put your shoes on.


697
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,611
How can I with my hands behind my back?


698
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:34,951
I see sandals right here.


699
00:24:35,572 --> 00:24:37,091
Well, put 'em on, buddy. Here.


700
00:24:38,871 --> 00:24:39,952
Oh, I can't do that.


701
00:24:40,451 --> 00:24:42,931
If you choose not to put them on, that is
your choice.


702
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:46,231
I got, I got two little sweet... I prefer my
little black ones in there, buddy. They're


703
00:24:46,231 --> 00:24:48,391
easier. I would prefer that I not had to come
here at all, ma'am.


704
00:24:48,571 --> 00:24:49,451
Well, Merry-


705
00:24:49,651 --> 00:24:52,071
To help you put your shoes on, but I will let
you put those sandals on.


706
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:54,531
Well, pull the black ones out. I don't want
those. I want those.


707
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:57,751
It's cold in jail, not those. There's
another-


708
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,111
Ma'am, when you get inside the jail, you
won't be wearing any shoes anyway.


709
00:25:00,111 --> 00:25:01,192
You'll be wearing their sandals.


710
00:25:01,471 --> 00:25:02,211
No, I won't.


711
00:25:02,651 --> 00:25:02,792
Yes, ma'am.


712
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,111
I'll be wearing my shoes, not those 'cause
they have polices.


713
00:25:06,871 --> 00:25:09,971
So, I'll take these ones. Can you wipe my-


714
00:25:10,251 --> 00:25:10,312
Will you zip it?


715
00:25:10,312 --> 00:25:10,692
... for me?


716
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:12,052
No, ma'am. No, I can't.


717
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:16,471
Who the's son are you? You're no friend of
mine. Yes, you are.


718
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:18,332
You can't even look at-


719
00:25:18,332 --> 00:25:18,911
Ma'am, please stop.


720
00:25:19,171 --> 00:25:21,171
No, I like you. What is your name?


721
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:22,331
Corporal D. Harris.


722
00:25:22,971 --> 00:25:24,311
Harris D.


723
00:25:25,432 --> 00:25:27,132
Where's your father from? New Mexico?


724
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:27,691
No.


725
00:25:27,971 --> 00:25:31,391
You can't be related to me. There's no way
you're related to me.


726
00:25:32,151 --> 00:25:33,531
Ma'am, how much you've had to drink today?


727
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:36,771
Not enough. I need to drink a lot more to
with you.


728
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:37,591
So-


729
00:25:37,611 --> 00:25:37,871
All right


730
00:25:37,871 --> 00:25:39,091
... where's my ID?


731
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:40,931
It's on fr- in front of my vest.


732
00:25:42,231 --> 00:25:43,571
Why is it on your vest?


733
00:25:43,711 --> 00:25:45,331
Because I took your ID to run you.


734
00:25:45,931 --> 00:25:47,391
Honey, I'll never do you.


735
00:25:48,071 --> 00:25:51,351
You got a on the top of your head. That's a
bad spot.


736
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:52,111
So-


737
00:25:52,231 --> 00:25:53,351
You have $9 in cash.


738
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:54,131
That's all I got?


739
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,031
That's all that was there.


740
00:25:55,051 --> 00:25:56,931
Okay, put the key and that in there.


741
00:25:57,691 --> 00:26:00,671
Ma'am, I'm not putting the hotel key, room in
here. You don't stay at this hotel anymore.


742
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,551
I need proof when I sue you, so I want my
key.


743
00:26:03,551 --> 00:26:04,731
This is a nice little video-


744
00:26:05,471 --> 00:26:05,491
Hey-


745
00:26:05,491 --> 00:26:06,531
... when you get an attorney.


746
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:08,211
Hold on. Hey.


747
00:26:08,991 --> 00:26:09,531
Uh-uh.


748
00:26:10,591 --> 00:26:11,431
I con.


749
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,611
What does your dog mean?


750
00:26:12,711 --> 00:26:17,511
While this woman definitely deserves a longer
stay behind bars for the way


751
00:26:17,571 --> 00:26:22,451
she treats her dog and the foul-mouthed
tirade she unleashes on the officers, she


752
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:24,951
was likely only looking at a day in jail.


753
00:26:24,971 --> 00:26:29,171
That didn't stop her from packing like she
was heading off to serve a life


754
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:29,971
sentence.


755
00:26:30,051 --> 00:26:31,191
Grab that sweatshirt.


756
00:26:31,471 --> 00:26:31,491
Ma'am.


757
00:26:31,491 --> 00:26:33,691
It's cold in jail. It's Sunday.


758
00:26:33,791 --> 00:26:34,131
Ma'am, we are leaving now.


759
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:37,111
They're gonna take the sweatshirt from you as
soon as you get in there.


760
00:26:37,231 --> 00:26:40,211
No, they won't. They'll just take the s-
sleeves out.


761
00:26:40,211 --> 00:26:40,231
Can I get the dog?


762
00:26:40,231 --> 00:26:40,471
Yeah.


763
00:26:41,491 --> 00:26:41,951
Okay.


764
00:26:42,751 --> 00:26:44,071
You can't touch my dog,


765
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:46,191
so just hand her my leash.


766
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:46,411
Come on, man.


767
00:26:46,411 --> 00:26:48,631
Hold on. No, you can't touch my dog.


768
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:49,011
Come on. Come on, man.


769
00:26:49,011 --> 00:26:52,531
Come on, Billy. Leave my dog alone. It's
against the law.


770
00:26:53,651 --> 00:26:54,591
Federal law.


771
00:26:55,191 --> 00:26:59,031
Where's my... There's my boo. Federal law.
Come on, Billy.


772
00:26:59,391 --> 00:27:01,571
Give me your leash. You're not allowed to
touch her.


773
00:27:02,651 --> 00:27:06,531
Alrighty. I'll your dad up, too. I'ma beat
his...


774
00:27:06,931 --> 00:27:11,651
Do you know who he is? I ain't seen him a
long time, but you look just


775
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:12,351
like him.


776
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:13,931
Uh,


777
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,031
he knows I'ma... him up. Billy gotta go
potty.


778
00:27:18,031 --> 00:27:20,271
[laughs]


779
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:22,451
Oh, my God.


780
00:27:24,051 --> 00:27:27,731
You're killing me, bud. You're... airport
police.


781
00:27:28,191 --> 00:27:31,411
You can't erase me. I'm not under arrest, am
I?


782
00:27:31,451 --> 00:27:32,391
You are under arrest.


783
00:27:32,631 --> 00:27:34,371
Okay. Put her back here with me.


784
00:27:34,971 --> 00:27:36,291
She's gonna go to the bathroom first.


785
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:37,991
I gotta pee, too.


786
00:27:38,051 --> 00:27:40,191
That's unfortunate. Please hold it. Have a
seat, ma'am.


787
00:27:40,311 --> 00:27:41,151
Okay, let go.


788
00:27:41,291 --> 00:27:42,151
Ma'am, have a seat in the car.


789
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:43,411
I have to get in my own way 'cause-


790
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:44,491
That's fine. Have a seat in the car.


791
00:27:44,511 --> 00:27:47,751
I will. Give me a second 'cause he's a really
tight brother.


792
00:27:48,311 --> 00:27:48,811
Harris,


793
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:50,771
let me get situated.


794
00:27:52,391 --> 00:27:55,971
You, you don't even know how to fish, you...
You're gay too?


795
00:27:57,091 --> 00:27:57,611
Hey, I thought-


796
00:27:57,611 --> 00:27:59,451
Ma'am, scoot over here. I need to put your
seatbelt on you.


797
00:27:59,451 --> 00:28:00,031
Which way?


798
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:00,731
Towards me.


799
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:02,011
Want me to suck your...


800
00:28:02,071 --> 00:28:02,091
No.


801
00:28:02,091 --> 00:28:03,071
I'm not gonna do that.


802
00:28:03,151 --> 00:28:04,871
Scoot over towards me so I can put your
seatbelt on.


803
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:10,291
You, oh, you're rough. You like it rough? Oh.


804
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:11,171
Ma'am, let go of the seatbelt.


805
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:11,571
Oh.


806
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:13,871
You like it rough.


807
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:18,091
Ma'am, I hope that when you sober up, you
feel some measure of regret for the way that


808
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,191
you're acting. Why are you taking it off
after all this if you think I'm drunk?


809
00:28:20,551 --> 00:28:21,271
All right, Ms. Lombardo.


810
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:22,851
To change the things I can.


811
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,751
I'm gonna let your dog ride in the back here
with you, all right? Do you understand?


812
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:28,571
Sure. Can she get in or you have to help her?


813
00:28:29,311 --> 00:28:30,051
Can she get in?


814
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:31,871
Of course she... She can.


815
00:28:31,871 --> 00:28:35,791
She can't, so you better help her. Come on,
boo. Uppity up. Uppity up.


816
00:28:36,851 --> 00:28:39,271
Can you just give her a boost, moron?


817
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:42,471
Boosty moron. Boosty Boo Boo.


818
00:28:43,011 --> 00:28:43,511
All right, ma'am.


819
00:28:43,931 --> 00:28:44,231
Now-


820
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:45,071
We're going to the jail.


821
00:28:45,331 --> 00:28:45,351
Go-


822
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:46,971
Once we get there, I have some forms for you.


823
00:28:46,971 --> 00:28:47,531
All right, listen.


824
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:48,511
One of those forms-


825
00:28:48,511 --> 00:28:48,891
Officer


826
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:51,351
... one of those forms is a ban form for this
facility.


827
00:28:51,511 --> 00:28:52,451
Officer, I'm speaking.


828
00:28:52,851 --> 00:28:53,751
Yes, ma'am. Yeah, I was talking to her.


829
00:28:53,751 --> 00:28:55,971
Officer, I don't care. I'm speaking.


830
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:56,431
All right, ma'am.


831
00:28:56,431 --> 00:28:57,571
I'm your senior.


832
00:28:57,591 --> 00:28:59,791
Uh, you're gonna come back here when you
wanna get your stuff.


833
00:29:00,051 --> 00:29:00,291
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,


834
00:29:00,291 --> 00:29:02,771
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la,


835
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,271
la. If you don't have an officer with you,
you will be going right back to jail. La, la,


836
00:29:05,271 --> 00:29:05,931
la, la, la, la, la. I'll talk to you. Very
mature.


837
00:29:06,171 --> 00:29:06,891
I'll talk to you.


838
00:29:06,891 --> 00:29:06,971
[laughs]


839
00:29:07,651 --> 00:29:09,051
Can you hear me, you punk?


840
00:29:09,191 --> 00:29:14,091
The officers were kind enough to let the dog
stay with her, a decision the dog would


841
00:29:14,151 --> 00:29:19,031
probably file a formal complaint about if he
had a voice. Still, she eventually cooperated


842
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:23,731
and went off to jail. You'd think a night
behind bars might humble her a bit, but


843
00:29:23,851 --> 00:29:24,251
prepare to be shocked.


844
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:28,411
I gotta say, man, this has been one of the
most entertaining rides I've ever had as an


845
00:29:30,271 --> 00:29:32,731
airport cop. So, first off, you're his boss,
is that correct?


846
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:33,191
Yep.


847
00:29:33,591 --> 00:29:35,191
Okay. Don't touch me.


848
00:29:35,271 --> 00:29:35,911
Step outta the vehicle please, ma'am.


849
00:29:35,911 --> 00:29:38,111
Don't tell me what to do. I'm speaking to
your boss.


850
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:38,451
Step outta the vehicle please, ma'am.


851
00:29:38,751 --> 00:29:42,751
I want your supervisor here right now. Call
your boss.


852
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:46,591
Call the mayor, get him here. Don't touch my
dog. Come on.


853
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:47,611
Nope, dog's staying.


854
00:29:47,611 --> 00:29:47,971
That's my dog.


855
00:29:47,971 --> 00:29:48,311
Dog's staying.


856
00:29:48,351 --> 00:29:48,991
No, you're not.


857
00:29:48,991 --> 00:29:49,691
Dog is staying.


858
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:51,471
Shoot me. Shoot me.


859
00:29:58,711 --> 00:30:00,471
You're going to jail, mother-


860
00:30:00,971 --> 00:30:01,651
Stand right here.


861
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:06,151
You're going to jail, both of you. I'ma have
your...


862
00:30:07,531 --> 00:30:09,451
Do you hear me? You are not my family.


863
00:30:10,451 --> 00:30:15,231
I know who your family is, and it's snakes.
You've... Both know you are.


864
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:17,811
You touch me again, mother- Touch me again.


865
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:18,291
Stand against the wall.


866
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:19,571
I already got assault on...


867
00:30:19,571 --> 00:30:22,511
... ch the wall, please. Hey, how are you?


868
00:30:22,511 --> 00:30:24,291
I'm all right. I'm patting you down. What's
the charge?


869
00:30:24,811 --> 00:30:26,371
Criminal trespass and obstruction.


870
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:27,031
Is this-


871
00:30:27,231 --> 00:30:27,331
Yeah.


872
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:28,171
How do you touch my pooch here?


873
00:30:28,191 --> 00:30:28,891
Dog's in the car.


874
00:30:28,891 --> 00:30:29,991
Okay, you can turn around for me.


875
00:30:29,991 --> 00:30:31,371
No, I don't want you to touch at all.


876
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:33,191
All right, you can turn around. Come on off
right here.


877
00:30:34,151 --> 00:30:34,591
He doesn't-


878
00:30:34,909 --> 00:30:37,109
... away from me. [car door thuds] That
mother [cutting out] snake.


879
00:30:37,109 --> 00:30:37,849
Yeah, don't open the car.


880
00:30:38,049 --> 00:30:41,569
Okay, got you. -Turn around, ma'am. Shut up.
-Turn around, ma'am. I'm talking to her.


881
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:45,250
You're going to jail motherf... They're gonna
you up your... You're gonna love it.


882
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:46,530
[clicks tongue]


883
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,209
All right, so we're here to go-


884
00:30:47,209 --> 00:30:51,229
Okay, these two mothers are bad boys. Do you
know what that is?


885
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:53,589
Picked this up?


886
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:57,730
You murderers. Hey, honey. How are you?


887
00:30:57,909 --> 00:30:57,969
Hi.


888
00:30:58,249 --> 00:30:58,749
Good, how are you?


889
00:30:58,749 --> 00:30:59,450
My stuff in.


890
00:31:00,449 --> 00:31:01,610
Good morning boys.


891
00:31:01,949 --> 00:31:02,950
Good morning. How are you?


892
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,109
You know how I am, motherf...


893
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:07,789
How are you? Because I'm going to beat you.


894
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,489
Man.


895
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:08,550
Oh, man.


896
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:08,570
Fuck.


897
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:09,789
Well, that's not very nice. [car door thuds]


898
00:31:09,789 --> 00:31:10,790
Yeah, turn around and face the car.


899
00:31:11,329 --> 00:31:12,310
Are you the boss?


900
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,389
Yes, ma'am.


901
00:31:13,449 --> 00:31:16,509
Okay, so we got some problems that I wanna
talk about today.


902
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:16,730
Left leg. Lift it up.


903
00:31:16,969 --> 00:31:18,810
Raise her leg up, so she can get the
handcuffs.


904
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,209
Miss Lombardo, here's what's going to happen.
Lombardo, excuse me.


905
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:21,969
You know what?


906
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:23,930
The things from your room are by your car
over there.


907
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,449
Where? Are they outside in the street?


908
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,269
Yeah, your dog is in the back seat of my car.


909
00:31:28,169 --> 00:31:31,049
You're gonna sign for your dog, you're gonna
take your things, you're gonna get in your


910
00:31:31,069 --> 00:31:31,729
car and you're gonna leave the property.


911
00:31:31,729 --> 00:31:31,829
First don't know-


912
00:31:31,829 --> 00:31:31,909
If you


913
00:31:32,009 --> 00:31:33,009
of all, I


914
00:31:33,109 --> 00:31:34,009
return to this property, you'll be going back
to jail.


915
00:31:34,009 --> 00:31:36,069
I don't hear you right now because you lost
something down here.


916
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:36,350
Ma'am.


917
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:36,889
Hold on, hold on.


918
00:31:37,029 --> 00:31:38,049
Something down there.


919
00:31:38,069 --> 00:31:40,150
Yourself there, make sure her car did not
move.


920
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:40,849
Yep. Lift your leg.


921
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:41,390
Ma'am.


922
00:31:41,709 --> 00:31:41,790
Lift your shoe.


923
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:42,249
You're the boss.


924
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,349
You're gonna sign for your dog.


925
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:43,730
Okay.


926
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:46,589
You're gonna take your dog back. You're gonna
put your things in your car and you're gonna


927
00:31:46,589 --> 00:31:46,950
leave the property.


928
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,729
Did you feed my dog?


929
00:31:47,729 --> 00:31:50,429
If you come back to this property, you are
going to go to jail.


930
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:50,630
Did you feed the dog?


931
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,049
Do you understand?


932
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,690
Man, not a problem. Did you feed the dog?


933
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,450
No, I didn't.


934
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:54,429
What time is it?


935
00:31:54,589 --> 00:31:55,130
I don't know.


936
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:59,069
If you wanted the care to happen to your dog,
you shouldn't have gone into jail.


937
00:31:59,069 --> 00:31:59,370
Get me my dog.


938
00:31:59,749 --> 00:32:01,069
Come with me. Come on.


939
00:32:01,289 --> 00:32:02,429
Did you clean that pen off?


940
00:32:02,429 --> 00:32:03,929
Ma'am, if you don't sign it, you don't get
the dog.


941
00:32:03,949 --> 00:32:04,190
Give me that.


942
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,530
I'll call Animal Control right now.


943
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:06,589
Oh, where am I signing?


944
00:32:06,929 --> 00:32:07,309
Right there.


945
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:10,809
Am I hurting your feelings in front of your
boss and your friends?


946
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:11,390
Thank you, ma'am.


947
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:13,990
Did they all know you're gay now? Hey,
babies.


948
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:17,189
She can get out by herself.


949
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:17,969
Come on, pup.


950
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,109
Don't touch my dog. Hey.


951
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:21,589
Ma'am.


952
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:22,249
Hey!


953
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:24,449
Ma'am. [car door thuds] Ma'am, you're
blocking traffic. Step over there, please.


954
00:32:24,449 --> 00:32:26,349
That's not my car you're blocking, dumb...


955
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,869
Take your things, get in your car and leave
the property, please. [door opens] .


956
00:32:34,189 --> 00:32:34,929
Oh, God.


957
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:35,889
Miss Lombardo.


958
00:32:36,229 --> 00:32:36,809
Yes?


959
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,449
I'm gonna give you 10 minutes and then I'm
gonna take you to jail for trespassing.


960
00:32:39,589 --> 00:32:41,889
Take your time, buddy. You're all set.


961
00:32:41,889 --> 00:32:46,309
[driverS laughing]


962
00:32:48,189 --> 00:32:51,309
She was charged with criminal trespass and
obstruction.


963
00:32:51,309 --> 00:32:55,009
[keyboard clacking] No matter how unhinged
she was, at least she acted her age.


964
00:32:55,089 --> 00:32:58,189
Our next suspect is no better than a teething
toddler.


965
00:32:58,189 --> 00:32:58,709
[crying]


966
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:02,389
Please, I want get out, please.


967
00:33:02,549 --> 00:33:07,289
As if getting caught shoplifting isn't
embarrassing enough, this woman manages to


968
00:33:07,349 --> 00:33:10,289
make it even worse by throwing a full-blown
tantrum.


969
00:33:10,289 --> 00:33:11,389
[Crying]


970
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:14,909
I didn't even get to eat my dinner.


971
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:19,929
On April 13th, 2024, Florida officers
responded to a call from a


972
00:33:19,949 --> 00:33:23,789
local Walmart about a woman accused of
shoplifting markers.


973
00:33:23,829 --> 00:33:28,049
She insisted she had money in her car, but
don't they all once they're caught


974
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:32,749
red-handed? One look at the CCTV footage
though and her story fell apart faster than


975
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:33,329
her story fell apart faster than her alibi.


976
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:34,789
I knocked her for trespassing warning,


977
00:33:35,809 --> 00:33:39,369
but I didn't talk to her and ask her any
questions in reference to the theft.


978
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:41,809
So, I'm gonna read her and start asking
questions.


979
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:42,849
She already trespassed?


980
00:33:43,149 --> 00:33:45,349
Yep. I didn't ask her anything in reference
to that.


981
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:45,369
No,


982
00:33:46,409 --> 00:33:46,589
sir.


983
00:33:47,389 --> 00:33:50,309
Hey, ma'am, I told you there's two gentlemen
that are gonna come and talk to you


984
00:33:51,149 --> 00:33:51,989
here in a few.


985
00:33:52,809 --> 00:33:53,789
What's, what's your name again?


986
00:33:53,849 --> 00:33:54,469
Jessica.


987
00:33:54,889 --> 00:33:55,389
Jessica?


988
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:56,009
Yeah.


989
00:33:56,489 --> 00:33:58,629
All right, meet me and Miranda.


990
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,849
Um, remember our game plan. So,


991
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,109
Kyle asked, Kyle, did you grab her driver's
license?


992
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:07,729
She had a picture of it on her phone.


993
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:12,949
Okay, all right. Your driver's license is
suspended, right? I mean, we're not worried


994
00:34:14,709 --> 00:34:16,009
about that here. Do you have anybody working
here?


995
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,349
My friend, she's outside.


996
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:19,329
Okay.


997
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:20,569
All right.


998
00:34:20,709 --> 00:34:22,009
She has my card and my wallet.


999
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:23,949
Okay. Remember our game plan.


1000
00:34:23,949 --> 00:34:24,249
Okay.


1001
00:34:24,269 --> 00:34:27,089
The first thing I would do, I would talk to
Lashonda.


1002
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,089
See what Lashonda has. She can chill right
here.


1003
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:31,909
Hold on.


1004
00:34:32,549 --> 00:34:33,549
What do you got in your pouch?


1005
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:35,429
Just


1006
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,029
stuff for at home.


1007
00:34:39,209 --> 00:34:40,809
Do you mind if we do a pat down on you?


1008
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,249
Yeah, that's fine.


1009
00:34:42,689 --> 00:34:43,809
Say that again, I can't hear you.


1010
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:44,289
You can do that.


1011
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:45,669
Okay, stand up for me, please.


1012
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:49,149
What I would do is ask her to take everything
out of her pouch.


1013
00:34:49,369 --> 00:34:52,669
This is mine, because I got it from
Walgreens. Those are mine.


1014
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:53,929
Okay.


1015
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:54,669
These are mine.


1016
00:34:55,289 --> 00:34:56,569
Those ones are all theirs.


1017
00:34:57,029 --> 00:34:58,669
Can you put the paper down on the ground?


1018
00:34:59,249 --> 00:35:03,509
So, what I would do is just place her, but we
don't necessarily have to do a pat down


1019
00:35:03,509 --> 00:35:04,449
because her, everything's inside.


1020
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:08,669
Um, ma'am, do you mind? This is what I would
do.


1021
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,129
Just lift your shirt up and spin around.


1022
00:35:11,969 --> 00:35:12,749
Are you good with that?


1023
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:15,169
I'm good with it too. You, you can


1024
00:35:16,249 --> 00:35:21,089
put your things back in here and just set
that on the floor. We'll go ahead and


1025
00:35:21,269 --> 00:35:23,549
interview you with Lashonda. I viewed her on
CCTV,


1026
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,889
um, opened up her hand package


1027
00:35:27,689 --> 00:35:28,549
pins,


1028
00:35:29,949 --> 00:35:32,229
um, that she selected over here in
stationary.


1029
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:32,529
Mm-hmm.


1030
00:35:32,709 --> 00:35:34,489
So fast-forward a little bit.


1031
00:35:34,989 --> 00:35:37,249
Well, she was placing it in her-


1032
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:38,969
Into her little fanny pack.


1033
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:39,889
Oh, okay.


1034
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:44,509
So, she must have stopped her hand here.


1035
00:35:51,589 --> 00:35:53,189
Did she actually try to walk out with it?


1036
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:57,469
She did. Um, I stopped her right outside, on
the sidewalk.


1037
00:35:57,509 --> 00:35:57,869
Right outside, okay.


1038
00:35:58,449 --> 00:35:59,669
Show you that clip next.


1039
00:35:59,689 --> 00:36:01,109
Lashonda, what, what's the total value amount
of the items?


1040
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,169
Um, 32.84.


1041
00:36:03,769 --> 00:36:08,129
Hey, I was just going outside to get my card,
please.


1042
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:09,969
And then, boom.


1043
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:14,109
So, what you doing, Sean? I, I, I know, I
know the answer of what you wanna do.


1044
00:36:14,509 --> 00:36:18,129
Uh, prosecute trespass. We already did the
trespass, so yeah, prosecute.


1045
00:36:18,429 --> 00:36:18,989
Fair enough.


1046
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:23,969
At this point, you're trespassed. It's just
that this guy doesn't want to talk to you


1047
00:36:24,089 --> 00:36:26,969
until he figured out what's gonna be next.


1048
00:36:27,009 --> 00:36:28,849
So, these were a pen, permanent marker?


1049
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:31,369
Um, pens, permanent marker-


1050
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:31,749
And where are you guys going to put them?


1051
00:36:31,749 --> 00:36:32,169
... and more


1052
00:36:33,009 --> 00:36:37,589
markers. I think they, I think they're all
markers. I think one type is a pen and the


1053
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:40,369
other ones are markers. Okay. Gonna ask you
some questions, but before I do,


1054
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:42,989
gonna read you your Miranda, okay?


1055
00:36:43,992 --> 00:36:44,252
All right.


1056
00:36:44,271 --> 00:36:45,871
I'm under arrest. [cries]


1057
00:36:46,531 --> 00:36:48,792
We're doing an investigation to figure that
out, all right?


1058
00:36:49,131 --> 00:36:49,151
Okay.


1059
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:51,471
Do you understand each of these rights I have
explained to you?


1060
00:36:51,852 --> 00:36:51,971
Yeah.


1061
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:53,812
Having these rights in mind, do you wish-


1062
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:53,832
[crying]


1063
00:36:53,832 --> 00:36:53,852
...


1064
00:36:54,471 --> 00:36:55,252
to talk with me now?


1065
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:59,151
I guess. I don't know.


1066
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:03,011
But do you understand each of these rights
that I explained to you?


1067
00:37:05,051 --> 00:37:05,371
For


1068
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:06,331
the most part. [crying]


1069
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:09,531
Would you like for me to read them again so
you can fully understand?


1070
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:14,751
No, I'm still not gonna fully understand. I
don't comprehend it.


1071
00:37:14,751 --> 00:37:16,532
[cries]


1072
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:17,411
Okay.


1073
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,671
Do you still wish to talk to me?


1074
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:25,032
All right, so e- explain to me, uh, what-
what was


1075
00:37:25,671 --> 00:37:27,732
the whole process of- of you


1076
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:30,331
inside the Walmart?


1077
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:35,111
[cries] Some of those were al- those were


1078
00:37:35,131 --> 00:37:37,131
already opened. [cries]


1079
00:37:37,131 --> 00:37:38,451
They were already opened in the aisle?


1080
00:37:38,451 --> 00:37:42,971
They were already opened in the aisle.
[cries] All I did was take one or two.


1081
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:47,131
I was gonna try them. I wanted to c- I was
going outside to get my card.


1082
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:47,911
All right.


1083
00:37:47,911 --> 00:37:49,091
I swear.


1084
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,531
Even if they were open,


1085
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:53,811
you know you can't just put them in your
pouch and leave, correct?


1086
00:37:54,811 --> 00:37:59,031
All right. And then on the, on the cameras,
we see you opening


1087
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,511
the packaging for the- for the markers.


1088
00:38:02,511 --> 00:38:05,751
[coughs] No, those were already open.


1089
00:38:06,471 --> 00:38:06,971
We have video.


1090
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:08,811
I promise. I promise.


1091
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:08,851
Okay.


1092
00:38:08,851 --> 00:38:12,791
I swear. You can zoom in. They... Those two
were already open.


1093
00:38:13,451 --> 00:38:16,071
All I did was take one... take the marker
out.


1094
00:38:16,691 --> 00:38:17,951
All right, so all the... all the-


1095
00:38:18,611 --> 00:38:19,631
The other one doesn't-


1096
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:24,571
All those item... All those items there, when
you look, you didn't intend to- to pay for


1097
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:24,871
it, you just walked out.


1098
00:38:25,251 --> 00:38:27,291
No, I was going to get my card.


1099
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:28,391
All right, so you-


1100
00:38:28,391 --> 00:38:31,951
I asked the lady up front to hold them, but
there's things that I had.


1101
00:38:32,751 --> 00:38:33,091
So,


1102
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:36,291
the person who was working, they held it for
you?


1103
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,171
Yeah, it's up front.


1104
00:38:38,331 --> 00:38:42,551
Okay. So, instead of you leaving, why not
have your friend go get your card for you?


1105
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,431
You said you have a friend, right?


1106
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,791
Because my phone was dead. I just plugged it
in in here.


1107
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:48,031
Oh, so your friend was waiting for you
outside?


1108
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:49,131
All right.


1109
00:38:49,191 --> 00:38:54,071
No, she went in here shopping and I was going
outside to try to find her so


1110
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:55,451
I could get the card.


1111
00:38:55,451 --> 00:38:56,431
[coughs]


1112
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:56,931
Okay.


1113
00:38:56,931 --> 00:38:59,471
'Cause I had money sent to her Cash App.


1114
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,591
[crying]


1115
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,171
So you had money on your card, but it was
inside your vehicle?


1116
00:39:03,491 --> 00:39:06,871
It was in her bag, in her purse. That's all.


1117
00:39:07,131 --> 00:39:10,891
I was going outside to get it. You can ask
the service station.


1118
00:39:11,611 --> 00:39:11,951
All right.


1119
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:13,051
I promise.


1120
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,911
So- so you may have left some items with
them, but you s- you did have stuff in


1121
00:39:16,911 --> 00:39:17,431
your... in your-


1122
00:39:17,451 --> 00:39:18,851
Yes, I did. [cries]


1123
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:19,831
You know you're not allowed to do that,
right?


1124
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:21,211
And I didn't buy it.


1125
00:39:21,911 --> 00:39:23,331
You know you're not allowed to do that,
right?


1126
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:24,311
I don't know.


1127
00:39:24,311 --> 00:39:25,451
No matter- no matter the amount?


1128
00:39:25,911 --> 00:39:27,431
I don't know. [music]


1129
00:39:27,751 --> 00:39:32,451
Sure, the shoplifting total was only $32.84,
but it was never about the money.


1130
00:39:32,491 --> 00:39:34,671
Given the chance, she probably would have
kept going.


1131
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:38,951
The cops knew that, and the moment she
realized she wasn't getting off easy, she


1132
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:43,731
ditched the excuses and dove straight into a
tantrum bad enough to embarrass a child.


1133
00:39:43,771 --> 00:39:46,791
Do you- do you take any- any medications or


1134
00:39:47,591 --> 00:39:48,371
anything like that?


1135
00:39:48,371 --> 00:39:51,691
Not yet. Monday, I have an appointment with
mental health.


1136
00:39:51,691 --> 00:39:52,571
[cries]


1137
00:39:52,571 --> 00:39:53,211
Where?


1138
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,811
In Port St. Lucie with...


1139
00:39:57,671 --> 00:39:59,011
with Bright... uh,


1140
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:01,631
with Bright Life.


1141
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:04,331
With- with who?


1142
00:40:04,571 --> 00:40:05,631
With Bright Life.


1143
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:06,591
Fright Life?


1144
00:40:06,911 --> 00:40:07,951
No, Bright-


1145
00:40:08,211 --> 00:40:08,811
Bright Life?


1146
00:40:08,811 --> 00:40:08,831
Life.


1147
00:40:09,831 --> 00:40:11,051
When is- when is that appointment?


1148
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:12,151
Monday.


1149
00:40:12,271 --> 00:40:12,891
On Monday?


1150
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:14,091
Okay.


1151
00:40:14,131 --> 00:40:15,351
Monday at 1:00.


1152
00:40:16,311 --> 00:40:17,591
All right. Um...


1153
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:23,431
Sorry, it's at 12:00 'cause she has an
opening between 11:00


1154
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:25,651
and 1:00. [cries]


1155
00:40:25,651 --> 00:40:27,131
All right, so- so based on my


1156
00:40:27,971 --> 00:40:31,171
investigation here, um, can you stand up? Do
you mind standing up?


1157
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:35,711
No. Please, why? Please don't take me.


1158
00:40:35,711 --> 00:40:38,251
I promise I gave them to her.


1159
00:40:38,651 --> 00:40:39,131
You left-


1160
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:41,091
I wasn't leaving.


1161
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:41,111
... you left the store yourself.


1162
00:40:41,111 --> 00:40:43,511
I didn't even make it out the door yet.


1163
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:44,331
Jessica, stand up.


1164
00:40:44,331 --> 00:40:44,891
[crying] I


1165
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:49,611
can't. I won't get out. Please.


1166
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:50,231
Jessica, stand up.


1167
00:40:50,231 --> 00:40:54,191
[crying] Please, I won't get out.


1168
00:40:54,211 --> 00:40:55,311
Please.


1169
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:56,831
Turn around. Turn around and face the wall.


1170
00:40:56,831 --> 00:41:01,031
[crying] Please, I won't get


1171
00:41:01,051 --> 00:41:05,551
out. [cries] I'm


1172
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:06,611
sorry.


1173
00:41:08,311 --> 00:41:08,551
Just go


1174
00:41:09,851 --> 00:41:09,871
up to the office and fill out a form.


1175
00:41:09,871 --> 00:41:11,451
Please, I don't have anyone's phone number.


1176
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:17,611
Okay.


1177
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:20,851
Please, sir, please. Please. [cries] What if
I'm at Meijer and was being honest?


1178
00:41:21,431 --> 00:41:21,811
Let's adjust this.


1179
00:41:21,811 --> 00:41:24,151
Is that the right thing to do?


1180
00:41:24,391 --> 00:41:27,071
Look, the- the- the way they were, she
definitely slipped them.


1181
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:27,551
Oh,


1182
00:41:28,491 --> 00:41:30,591
please. [cries]


1183
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:31,611
Hold on. One second.


1184
00:41:31,631 --> 00:41:33,111
Please.


1185
00:41:33,351 --> 00:41:33,371
Keep going. Keep going.


1186
00:41:33,411 --> 00:41:35,551
I was gonna pay for them.


1187
00:41:36,131 --> 00:41:36,371
Okay. That's good.


1188
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:41,051
Please, sir, please. Please. Ma'am,


1189
00:41:41,171 --> 00:41:43,311
please. I'm homeless.


1190
00:41:43,651 --> 00:41:43,691
Keep going. Keep going.


1191
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:47,851
Please, I can just pay for them. Please, I
wanted to


1192
00:41:47,851 --> 00:41:52,691
help. Please, I won't get my health...


1193
00:41:53,051 --> 00:41:54,951
Please, I won't get my health...


1194
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:55,331
Come see me.


1195
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:59,171
Please, I won't get my health... Please.


1196
00:41:59,171 --> 00:41:59,511
[cries]


1197
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:00,071
Jessica, stop.


1198
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:02,271
Is this charger yours?


1199
00:42:02,711 --> 00:42:03,491
No.


1200
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,551
It's just your phone?


1201
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:06,111
Yes.


1202
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:11,171
Can you please give that- my bag to my
friend, please?


1203
00:42:12,271 --> 00:42:13,051
Please?


1204
00:42:13,491 --> 00:42:14,331
I don't know about that.


1205
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,971
Oh, please, can you give her my bag? Oh,
please.


1206
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:21,831
This is all my markers. Please. [cries]


1207
00:42:22,111 --> 00:42:23,631
Please, ma'am.


1208
00:42:23,631 --> 00:42:25,131
Jessica, come to line one, please.


1209
00:42:25,131 --> 00:42:27,871
Can I please blow my nose, please?


1210
00:42:29,091 --> 00:42:34,031
Please, I'm sorry. Please, people do this all


1211
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:35,411
the time and you let them


1212
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:40,317
go.I can't even


1213
00:42:40,317 --> 00:42:40,597
think. [crying]


1214
00:42:40,597 --> 00:42:41,997
Well, here's the thing, you can't-


1215
00:42:42,417 --> 00:42:42,437
Why?


1216
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,697
... because you don't have ties to Indian
River County.


1217
00:42:44,737 --> 00:42:45,077
I do.


1218
00:42:45,077 --> 00:42:45,917
If you had ties to Indian River County-


1219
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:48,637
My kid is here, my sister's here.


1220
00:42:48,817 --> 00:42:51,457
If you had ties to Indian River County, you
had an address here.


1221
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:51,978
I do.


1222
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:55,637
You can just write me what it is. It's still
a criminal charge, it's still the same thing.


1223
00:42:55,777 --> 00:42:56,798
It is what it is. I know, but-


1224
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:57,398
It is what it is


1225
00:42:57,398 --> 00:43:00,257
... please don't take me there. Please, I'll
pay.


1226
00:43:00,257 --> 00:43:00,318
[crying]


1227
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:04,797
That decision's already been made, which is a
properly made decision by Deputy Saunders.


1228
00:43:05,138 --> 00:43:08,737
Please, I was gonna pay. I even told her I
would pay.


1229
00:43:08,737 --> 00:43:10,597
Well, well, Walmart don't... they don't play.


1230
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:14,537
I know. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I'm not
in the right state of mind.


1231
00:43:14,537 --> 00:43:16,678
Walmart doesn't play around, they prosecute.


1232
00:43:17,297 --> 00:43:19,737
That's... and that... when they wanna press
charges,


1233
00:43:20,817 --> 00:43:22,798
we have to serve them the way they want.


1234
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:25,297
Please don't put me in jail.


1235
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:27,058
Please, I-


1236
00:43:27,058 --> 00:43:29,117
It's a $500 bond. You have to-


1237
00:43:29,117 --> 00:43:31,058
[crying] I don't have $500.


1238
00:43:31,058 --> 00:43:31,117
- shert down.


1239
00:43:31,117 --> 00:43:35,097
I don't even have but 40 bucks. Please.


1240
00:43:36,117 --> 00:43:36,137
I


1241
00:43:36,837 --> 00:43:39,757
promise I'll pay the 40 and leave the
markers.


1242
00:43:40,537 --> 00:43:40,757
I don't believe you. Can you mail them in?


1243
00:43:40,757 --> 00:43:43,017
I have my kid here, my son is here.


1244
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:44,397
We'll search. Please call him now. Now.


1245
00:43:44,477 --> 00:43:44,777
I have-


1246
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:45,397
Let him come down for a few moments.


1247
00:43:45,397 --> 00:43:48,737
I'm raised here, born and raised. I've, I've
lived here my whole life.


1248
00:43:48,857 --> 00:43:53,077
Timothy's on harassment, Joanna's on reckless
negativity.


1249
00:43:53,077 --> 00:43:53,697
[crying]


1250
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,497
Like, us one, something like that.


1251
00:43:55,517 --> 00:43:55,597
Mm-hmm.


1252
00:43:55,597 --> 00:43:57,597
Like, way down the road as insanity, so.


1253
00:43:58,077 --> 00:43:59,377
Please. Please.


1254
00:43:59,377 --> 00:44:01,737
[clears throat]


1255
00:44:01,937 --> 00:44:04,937
I have my kid here. I will come to court.


1256
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,297
I've did my time here already.


1257
00:44:07,577 --> 00:44:12,237
Apparently she doesn't have bail money. Well,
how would she if she's spent it on weed?


1258
00:44:12,297 --> 00:44:17,017
Clearly this woman needs to set her
priorities straight, and jail is the perfect


1259
00:44:17,077 --> 00:44:17,997
place to do that.


1260
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:19,677
Please, I don't have $500 to sit there
forever all day by myself.


1261
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:23,317
You got, uh, these two copies here? Do we
need two or just one?


1262
00:44:23,577 --> 00:44:24,917
Um, just by myself.


1263
00:44:24,917 --> 00:44:29,717
Do, do you want him, do you want him to give
your friend a call to tell, to tell her what


1264
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:30,337
happened so she's not waiting for you?


1265
00:44:30,497 --> 00:44:30,637
Yeah.


1266
00:44:31,217 --> 00:44:31,997
She can't remember?


1267
00:44:32,277 --> 00:44:34,077
Please, no one's in my phone.


1268
00:44:34,097 --> 00:44:35,477
Can we look forward in your phone?


1269
00:44:36,457 --> 00:44:36,477
Yeah.


1270
00:44:36,477 --> 00:44:37,557
We're not searching your phone.


1271
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:42,357
No, please. Can you please go to my car log?


1272
00:44:43,917 --> 00:44:44,837
Hi, Tyler. What's your name?


1273
00:44:44,877 --> 00:44:45,177
Service.


1274
00:44:45,317 --> 00:44:46,197
Holly.


1275
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:52,577
I'm not gonna be able to get out. [crying]
Please, I have


1276
00:44:52,577 --> 00:44:55,737
an appointment on Monday with Bright Lights.


1277
00:44:55,737 --> 00:44:57,537
They can vouch for me and


1278
00:44:58,377 --> 00:45:03,277
hold my ties. I promise. [crying] I can


1279
00:45:03,357 --> 00:45:04,397
call her.


1280
00:45:05,617 --> 00:45:07,257
She can vouch for me.


1281
00:45:09,017 --> 00:45:11,277
My son's here, my sister's here.


1282
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,277
I was born and raised here. I lived in Vero
Beach.


1283
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:19,937
We'll call her in a little while once we
clear the scene and let her know what's


1284
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,517
happened. All right. So you got, you got
this?


1285
00:45:22,577 --> 00:45:22,717
Mm-hmm.


1286
00:45:22,857 --> 00:45:25,697
I'll grab this. You, you just maintain
control of your suspect.


1287
00:45:28,377 --> 00:45:28,777
Stand up.


1288
00:45:28,777 --> 00:45:31,877
Well, can I please wipe my face off?


1289
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:32,177
Sure you can.


1290
00:45:32,177 --> 00:45:33,317
Can you just wipe it for me? [crying]


1291
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:35,177
I'll, I'll turn around. Yes, that's all
right.


1292
00:45:35,177 --> 00:45:35,497
Okay.


1293
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:38,497
No, please. I'm


1294
00:45:39,717 --> 00:45:40,037
sorry. I'm so


1295
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:41,717
sorry.


1296
00:45:42,377 --> 00:45:46,837
My kid's here. Please, I promise, I have all
my ties to the world


1297
00:45:46,937 --> 00:45:47,437
here.


1298
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:52,417
Please, it's really cold out. They're gonna
make me freeze in there.


1299
00:45:52,437 --> 00:45:52,677
That's,


1300
00:45:53,477 --> 00:45:53,797
that's starting to get real.


1301
00:45:53,797 --> 00:45:57,637
Please, I, I don't feel good. I don't wanna
do this.


1302
00:45:57,817 --> 00:46:02,457
Please, I'll never get out [crying] in time
for my


1303
00:46:02,497 --> 00:46:05,297
mental health appointment. Please, sir,


1304
00:46:06,377 --> 00:46:08,137
I don't understand.


1305
00:46:09,257 --> 00:46:11,417
I don't understand. Step up.


1306
00:46:11,417 --> 00:46:16,137
[crying] I don't understand. Oh, can you give
her my bag, please?


1307
00:46:16,137 --> 00:46:17,977
Her car's right over there.


1308
00:46:18,357 --> 00:46:18,477
This car?


1309
00:46:18,477 --> 00:46:20,237
Look, her trunk is open. Look! Please.


1310
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:20,817
Whose car is it?


1311
00:46:21,017 --> 00:46:25,437
Please. It's that Jeep right over there, in
front of that handicap spot right there.


1312
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:25,837
The what? That's-


1313
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:28,717
Just give her my, my fanny pack and keep my
phone.


1314
00:46:28,797 --> 00:46:29,117
Okay.


1315
00:46:29,577 --> 00:46:31,197
Please. [crying]


1316
00:46:31,197 --> 00:46:32,177
All right, what do we need to do?


1317
00:46:32,237 --> 00:46:34,277
You can go ask her, please, good morning.


1318
00:46:34,297 --> 00:46:36,577
Stay there while we wait to see Jay?


1319
00:46:36,897 --> 00:46:40,437
I have mental health on Monday. Please don't
let me miss it.


1320
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:42,737
Please,


1321
00:46:43,377 --> 00:46:44,617
I'm so sorry.


1322
00:46:45,297 --> 00:46:48,777
I'll drive to jail. You just take care of the
radio, but we'll wait until Kyle.


1323
00:46:48,777 --> 00:46:49,457
[crying]


1324
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:51,937
Please,


1325
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:57,657
sir, please. I have n- I have no money.


1326
00:46:58,017 --> 00:47:00,917
I just have enough to cover the markers, $30.


1327
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:01,717
Keep going.


1328
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:03,957
$30 and I have to pay $500.


1329
00:47:04,257 --> 00:47:04,857
So?


1330
00:47:06,197 --> 00:47:06,817
It was six markers.


1331
00:47:06,817 --> 00:47:07,717
All right, ready, go.


1332
00:47:08,277 --> 00:47:08,897
Hold the mileage.


1333
00:47:08,917 --> 00:47:12,677
Oh, God, please. Look, there she goes. Look,
there she goes.


1334
00:47:12,697 --> 00:47:15,017
Please, can you give her my fanny pack,
please?


1335
00:47:15,117 --> 00:47:15,777
He, he gave it to her.


1336
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:15,997
We did.


1337
00:47:15,997 --> 00:47:16,357
Huh?


1338
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,017
He gave it to her.


1339
00:47:17,397 --> 00:47:20,777
Okay. Can she, can she just pay for me?


1340
00:47:20,857 --> 00:47:22,557
Dispatch has been updated.


1341
00:47:22,857 --> 00:47:22,877
Please.


1342
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:24,237
You let her know I got her bag?


1343
00:47:25,477 --> 00:47:27,677
Okay, um, okay. Thank you.


1344
00:47:28,257 --> 00:47:31,757
Oh, no, please. Holly, please. [crying]


1345
00:47:33,757 --> 00:47:38,617
I don't understand. You guys have let other
people go before


1346
00:47:39,597 --> 00:47:44,217
for more than this. I have ties, I swear to


1347
00:47:44,257 --> 00:47:46,597
God. Why me?


1348
00:47:48,297 --> 00:47:52,677
You know, the price went down the minute she
changed those markers, elf?


1349
00:47:53,257 --> 00:47:57,617
She changed the box. She counted it for 31
with that big case.


1350
00:47:58,237 --> 00:48:02,597
That's not fair. I was gonna pay her, uh, for


1351
00:48:02,697 --> 00:48:03,317
them,


1352
00:48:04,157 --> 00:48:08,357
and she could've kept them. [crying]


1353
00:48:08,897 --> 00:48:11,957
I'll never make my appointment.


1354
00:48:12,717 --> 00:48:15,097
I didn't even get to eat my dinner.


1355
00:48:16,257 --> 00:48:20,537
I'm gonna freeze. Oh, could you get my jacket
from her?


1356
00:48:22,157 --> 00:48:25,317
Oh, it's not fair.


1357
00:48:25,317 --> 00:48:27,337
[crying]


1358
00:48:27,517 --> 00:48:27,537
45 minutes, right? Yeah.


1359
00:48:27,537 --> 00:48:31,277
My son goes to Glenville Baptist and my
sister works there.


1360
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:32,797
Please.


1361
00:48:34,177 --> 00:48:36,037
Why did I get the treaty?


1362
00:48:37,297 --> 00:48:38,317
Oh!


1363
00:48:38,977 --> 00:48:43,057
Oh, god, [crying] please.


1364
00:48:45,715 --> 00:48:47,255
[police sirens] Jessica, do you have anything
on you?


1365
00:48:47,975 --> 00:48:49,055
What do you mean?


1366
00:48:49,155 --> 00:48:51,616
Do you have anything illegal in your bra or
anywhere else?


1367
00:48:51,616 --> 00:48:51,795
[police sirens]


1368
00:48:51,795 --> 00:48:55,096
Yes. I have a little bit of weed on me.


1369
00:48:56,715 --> 00:49:00,395
Literally the size of a penny. [laughs]
Please don't...


1370
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,775
Okay. Dude, that's good because


1371
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:05,175
if you brought that into jail,


1372
00:49:06,475 --> 00:49:07,095
it would be an ex-


1373
00:49:07,095 --> 00:49:08,735
Call me possession of contraband. [police
sirens]


1374
00:49:08,995 --> 00:49:12,115
Yes. All right, good. N- now we're getting
somewhere.


1375
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,536
If it's under 20 grams, we're not gonna
charge you with it.


1376
00:49:16,075 --> 00:49:18,415
It's literally the size of my thumb.


1377
00:49:18,636 --> 00:49:19,296
Where is it?


1378
00:49:19,296 --> 00:49:20,376
It's in my bra.


1379
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:22,016
Okay.


1380
00:49:22,235 --> 00:49:23,535
I forgot about it.


1381
00:49:24,156 --> 00:49:24,775
That's okay.


1382
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:28,955
W- where... i- if it's under 20 grams, we
will not charge you.


1383
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:31,436
Okay. [police sirens]


1384
00:49:31,456 --> 00:49:32,635
Thank you for being honest.


1385
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:35,755
There's no reason to c- for you to catch a
felony.


1386
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:36,575
I've been 20 years on this call, cop.


1387
00:49:36,575 --> 00:49:38,775
There's no reason for you to catch a felony
for this.


1388
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,875
[police sirens] Ah, I'm gonna be in here all
weekend.


1389
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:44,815
I have that mental health appointment on
Monday, please.


1390
00:49:45,295 --> 00:49:47,315
The woman was charged with petty theft.


1391
00:49:47,455 --> 00:49:52,175
Detective Dale always says it's almost
impossible to reason with entitled suspects


1392
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:57,075
with entitled suspects with main character
syndrome. Most of the time, cops can spot it


1393
00:49:57,075 --> 00:50:01,575
from a mile away, but they still give them a
chance to clear their story. And nine times


1394
00:50:01,715 --> 00:50:04,715
out of 10, it ends the same way, with
handcuffs. This isn't the first time we've


1395
00:50:04,735 --> 00:50:09,475
caught Karens in full action either. So, if

Otherwise, I'll sue you, you and you.


1399
00:50:17,335 --> 00:50:22,275
On March 1st, 2024, a Lake County officer was
patrolling when he noticed a


1400
00:50:22,295 --> 00:50:26,615
white Chevy swerving like it was auditioning
for a demolition derby.


1401
00:50:26,615 --> 00:50:31,475
At first, he wasn't planning to pull it over,
until the car nearly hit the curb and came to


1402
00:50:31,475 --> 00:50:36,415
a shaky stop. The driver's choice of parking
was a big giveaway that everything was not


1403
00:50:36,535 --> 00:50:38,195
well inside the vehicle.


1404
00:50:38,235 --> 00:50:38,255
10-4.


1405
00:50:38,255 --> 00:50:45,335
Montana


1406
00:50:45,715 --> 00:50:48,395
450 to Montana 392. Can you be 51?


1407
00:50:52,655 --> 00:51:02,135
26.


1408
00:51:03,195 --> 00:51:04,355
Where, where you coming from?


1409
00:51:05,475 --> 00:51:07,535
I am coming from, um...


1410
00:51:07,795 --> 00:51:08,995
Do


1411
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:17,915
you


1412
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:19,155
have your, your registration?


1413
00:51:20,275 --> 00:51:24,875
Yes. Yes, I do.


1414
00:51:26,395 --> 00:51:28,995
Um, why do I feel like you're speeding?


1415
00:51:30,095 --> 00:51:31,495
D- do you know why I pulled you over?


1416
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:35,535
Um, was it... I was speeding? I don't know.
Maybe.


1417
00:51:35,535 --> 00:51:38,775
So, w- w- when I'm coming down the road, you,
you swerved and avoided-


1418
00:51:38,775 --> 00:51:40,175
I came from, I came from


1419
00:51:40,295 --> 00:51:42,955
back ass, and I avoided something.


1420
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,695
Yeah, you, you swerved-


1421
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:45,895
And I remember going very-


1422
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,555
Hold on. Listen, listen, l- listen-


1423
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,415
... far away from what I was avoiding-


1424
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:50,035
Listen to me.


1425
00:51:50,035 --> 00:51:51,415
And then I turned left.


1426
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,675
Yeah. So you came down this road and you


1427
00:51:54,315 --> 00:51:56,115
was all on this side of the road driving.


1428
00:51:56,775 --> 00:51:59,015
I had to stop my vehicle for you to get back
over.


1429
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:03,735
I turned around to follow you and you were
just about crashing to the, over the curb


1430
00:52:05,275 --> 00:52:06,455
over the curb over there. Until I got behind
you.


1431
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:07,435
I'm sorry, what curb?


1432
00:52:07,695 --> 00:52:11,175
The curb on Alexander. And then, as I-


1433
00:52:11,175 --> 00:52:12,235
I'm sorry, what was I gonna crash into?


1434
00:52:12,255 --> 00:52:16,795
Listen, and then... And then, as I, as I
pulled you over, do you know you came over


1435
00:52:17,155 --> 00:52:18,535
the curb into someone's yard?


1436
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:20,535
My goodness. Your light is reflecting in my
pupil.


1437
00:52:20,535 --> 00:52:21,095
So, look, do,


1438
00:52:21,755 --> 00:52:23,235
do you see where you're at? You're, you're...


1439
00:52:23,235 --> 00:52:24,655
You crossed the curb and-


1440
00:52:25,095 --> 00:52:29,995
Uh, you, you have now pulled me over, and
what else am I


1441
00:52:30,015 --> 00:52:33,055
supposed to do but pull over into the most-


1442
00:52:33,235 --> 00:52:35,295
No, all you had to do was pull over to the
side over here.


1443
00:52:35,295 --> 00:52:39,415
My mother, my mother told me to pull over in
the most,


1444
00:52:40,355 --> 00:52:42,475
uh, credible place.


1445
00:52:42,515 --> 00:52:42,895
Okay.


1446
00:52:42,915 --> 00:52:47,515
As in, if I were to pull over with somebody
rather their


1447
00:52:47,935 --> 00:52:49,115
yard, and then this place-


1448
00:52:49,115 --> 00:52:51,755
No, you, you crossed the, you crossed the
whole curb


1449
00:52:52,515 --> 00:52:53,995
to... I forget, I-


1450
00:52:53,995 --> 00:52:54,895
To get into a place...


1451
00:52:55,655 --> 00:52:56,115
This is a one-way road, sir.


1452
00:52:56,115 --> 00:52:59,535
Okay, okay. Just get back in the car. Okay,
get back in the, get back in the car for me.


1453
00:52:59,575 --> 00:53:00,415
Just step back in the car for me.


1454
00:53:00,435 --> 00:53:00,815
No.


1455
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:02,155
Step back in the car for me.


1456
00:53:02,915 --> 00:53:02,935
Okay.


1457
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:03,575
This is a one-way road.


1458
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:05,415
Okay, step back in the car. I, I...


1459
00:53:06,055 --> 00:53:06,895
Step... Get back in the car.


1460
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:08,135
Hunter.


1461
00:53:08,135 --> 00:53:08,915
Get back in the car.


1462
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,435
Hunter?


1463
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:14,235
Either you get back in the car or I detain
you.


1464
00:53:15,075 --> 00:53:15,875
Right here in the car.


1465
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:20,875
Yes, sir. Um, who are you?


1466
00:53:20,915 --> 00:53:22,475
Just take a note. Just take a seat.


1467
00:53:22,755 --> 00:53:23,955
Who are you? Oh, wow.


1468
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:26,615
Why are there so many people?


1469
00:53:26,975 --> 00:53:29,555
Here, can you still record? Can you still
record and let me show you what happened?


1470
00:53:29,555 --> 00:53:31,795
Oh my God, I am not like a robber or
something.


1471
00:53:31,795 --> 00:53:33,435
No, we're not. Did we say that?


1472
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:35,115
Can I go back home?


1473
00:53:35,315 --> 00:53:36,035
No, we cannot.


1474
00:53:36,035 --> 00:53:36,055
Like, guys-


1475
00:53:36,055 --> 00:53:36,735
Sorry. Sorry


1476
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:38,455
Why can I not go back home?


1477
00:53:38,915 --> 00:53:39,775
I'll be right back.


1478
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:43,135
Okay, he's gonna talk to you in just a
second. Okay.


1479
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:43,395
Okay. Thank you.


1480
00:53:43,395 --> 00:53:44,435
Nope, don't send...


1481
00:53:46,575 --> 00:53:47,515
He's grabbing your purse.


1482
00:53:47,555 --> 00:53:48,635
My purse,


1483
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:50,755
my wallet.


1484
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:51,975
Okay, that's perfectly fine.


1485
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:53,535
Going into the purse.


1486
00:53:56,295 --> 00:54:00,335
She's, she's gone. Oh, she's gone. Yeah. But
it's not the same one. Oh, it's not? Okay.


1487
00:54:00,915 --> 00:54:02,795
You didn't see her tattoos? Okay.


1488
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:04,935
Here. She's,


1489
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,435
she's, she's live. Yeah, can you... I need to
talk to Mason.


1490
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:11,175
Can you tell, watch out for me?


1491
00:54:11,655 --> 00:54:14,535
Check my car without my permission. We have
to talk to him.


1492
00:54:14,535 --> 00:54:15,435
He wants to talk. He wants to talk.


1493
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:19,575
Without my permission, so- Can you wait right
here for him, okay? Without my permission.


1494
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:22,735
So... Um, are you guys looking for somebody


1495
00:54:23,355 --> 00:54:24,195
specific?


1496
00:54:24,775 --> 00:54:25,815
No. No.


1497
00:54:26,195 --> 00:54:29,275
Then why are you guys doing this to me?


1498
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:33,375
Well, usually we don't, like, stop people at
this, late at night, so...


1499
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:34,275
And, and my person-


1500
00:54:34,295 --> 00:54:38,535
So why did you guys do this when I didn't do
anything wrong?


1501
00:54:39,935 --> 00:54:44,035
Because I haven't done anything wrong and I
have kids and a husband.


1502
00:54:44,035 --> 00:54:44,815
[crying]


1503
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:45,815
Okay.


1504
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:46,915
So tell me,


1505
00:54:47,015 --> 00:54:47,935
why did you stop me, sir?


1506
00:54:48,435 --> 00:54:50,995
I don't know. I, I wasn't the one that
stopped you, so I can't say.


1507
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,015
You don't know?


1508
00:54:53,725 --> 00:54:55,165
Where the [beep] is my phone?


1509
00:54:56,645 --> 00:55:01,186
So I'm driving on 11, and she's on the
opposite side of the road.


1510
00:55:02,586 --> 00:55:03,205
Coming at you?


1511
00:55:03,225 --> 00:55:07,905
Coming at me. So I was just like, "Stop." I'm
like, "Oh, what is she doing?" She swerved


1512
00:55:07,925 --> 00:55:08,985
back over and the car get to shaking. I'm
like-


1513
00:55:09,546 --> 00:55:10,105
Are you out of your mind? Did you really-


1514
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:12,425
"Not right." So I just made a U-turn, you
know-


1515
00:55:12,626 --> 00:55:13,365
Because I had it done!


1516
00:55:13,365 --> 00:55:18,185
I'm not gonna do a traffic stop yet. I, I
turn around and she's like at the stop sign,


1517
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:18,685
like at the stop sign, like facing this way.


1518
00:55:18,905 --> 00:55:19,445
At 11th?


1519
00:55:19,925 --> 00:55:20,646
On Alexander.


1520
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:20,985
On Alexander?


1521
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,626
On, on a stop sign, I'm like, "Oh yeah, I'm,
I, I...


1522
00:55:23,626 --> 00:55:24,445
it's just..."


1523
00:55:24,466 --> 00:55:25,705
So then how'd you guys end up here?


1524
00:55:25,925 --> 00:55:28,066
So I flipped my lights on back there.


1525
00:55:28,385 --> 00:55:28,445
Yeah.


1526
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:29,545
And I'm calling at the, uh,


1527
00:55:30,285 --> 00:55:34,785
the 28th. She stops and then goes again, and
then comes around here.


1528
00:55:35,405 --> 00:55:37,385
Come over here, makes a U-turn


1529
00:55:38,065 --> 00:55:39,525
and then hopped the curb. [laughs]


1530
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:42,285
She's definitely... I think she's under the
influence. I smell the alcohol.


1531
00:55:42,285 --> 00:55:42,826
I smell she-


1532
00:55:42,826 --> 00:55:43,625
She's pissed herself.


1533
00:55:43,945 --> 00:55:45,185
And she cannot give me... She-


1534
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:45,825
But I just want to make sure-


1535
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:47,045
She's not making any stops.


1536
00:55:47,045 --> 00:55:47,065
She's not?


1537
00:55:47,065 --> 00:55:47,745
Yeah. So...


1538
00:55:48,105 --> 00:55:49,305
What the [beep] do you want?


1539
00:55:49,305 --> 00:55:50,485
[laughs]


1540
00:55:50,485 --> 00:55:51,125
What do you want?


1541
00:55:51,405 --> 00:55:52,185
I wanna know why-


1542
00:55:52,185 --> 00:55:53,025
Look at me more.


1543
00:55:53,265 --> 00:55:56,165
I wanna know how you ended up on the, the,
the grass here?


1544
00:55:56,465 --> 00:56:01,425
Because I pulled over and there is no way to
pull over on


1545
00:56:01,465 --> 00:56:05,805
a one-way street, other than turning into a


1546
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:10,685
U-turn to pull over so that other civilians
can


1547
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:15,645
still pull forward and make their way through
their route without me being


1548
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,905
in their way. Is there any other questions?


1549
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:19,165
I don't have any more.


1550
00:56:19,165 --> 00:56:23,865
[camera clicking] This is when the officers
hit her with a crucial bit of reality she's


1551
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:27,545
far too hammered to grasp. She's drunk and
it's time for a sobriety test.


1552
00:56:27,565 --> 00:56:31,845
You'd think her instant agreement means
she'll comply, but you're in for a surprise.


1553
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:36,965
Okay, I have reason to believe that you're
under the influence of alcohol or some


1554
00:56:37,045 --> 00:56:37,685
substance.


1555
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:38,165
Okay.


1556
00:56:38,165 --> 00:56:38,445
So


1557
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:42,925
the next step is doing the sobriety field
exercises.


1558
00:56:43,305 --> 00:56:43,345
Okay.


1559
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:44,445
Do you consent to doing


1560
00:56:45,105 --> 00:56:46,025
the exercises?


1561
00:56:46,505 --> 00:56:46,525
Field?


1562
00:56:46,525 --> 00:56:50,105
Consent. Do you... It's a yes or no. If you
don't wanna do 'em, you say no.


1563
00:56:50,105 --> 00:56:51,465
If you are willing to do them-


1564
00:56:51,465 --> 00:56:53,085
Yeah, I'll do your, I'll do your field.


1565
00:56:53,585 --> 00:56:54,185
All right.


1566
00:56:58,685 --> 00:56:59,905
Please.


1567
00:57:00,805 --> 00:57:02,225
She got some tape and everything.


1568
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:03,985
Can you come this way with me?


1569
00:57:04,645 --> 00:57:06,225
I have been


1570
00:57:07,005 --> 00:57:07,945
pulled over.


1571
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:10,285
Please.


1572
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:10,325
You want to come up on the-


1573
00:57:10,325 --> 00:57:11,805
Thank you. Let me see.


1574
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:12,625
Rachel.


1575
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:14,805
Rachel, can you come this way with me?


1576
00:57:14,985 --> 00:57:15,465
Yes, sir.


1577
00:57:15,585 --> 00:57:17,465
Can you put all your bags and stuff inside
of,


1578
00:57:19,545 --> 00:57:20,505
inside of your, your car?


1579
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:21,345
All of my bags?


1580
00:57:21,425 --> 00:57:21,865
Yes.


1581
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:24,265
But like at illegal police base?


1582
00:57:24,265 --> 00:57:26,185
No, I just want, just want you to put your
bags-


1583
00:57:26,385 --> 00:57:28,245
Did I kill somebody? [crying]


1584
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:28,545
No.


1585
00:57:28,585 --> 00:57:30,085
Did I hurt somebody?


1586
00:57:32,165 --> 00:57:32,405
No, but-


1587
00:57:32,425 --> 00:57:35,485
Someone tell me the reason why all of this is
necessary.


1588
00:57:35,505 --> 00:57:38,605
I told you, when I was driving down, down the
street, you swerve.


1589
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:40,005
You was on the other side of the street.


1590
00:57:40,005 --> 00:57:44,965
Yeah, I swerved. I just got back from my
girlfriend, my very best friend


1591
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:49,845
Erica's house. And she's on [crying] the
street that the


1592
00:57:49,945 --> 00:57:54,845
shell station is on. And I was trying to get
my [beep] music


1593
00:57:54,925 --> 00:57:56,805
right and I might've swerved


1594
00:57:57,405 --> 00:58:02,365
trying to get my music 'cause she's on the
shell station street, but I promise you


1595
00:58:02,405 --> 00:58:03,185
I'm not [beep]


1596
00:58:03,805 --> 00:58:07,245
anything up. I'm not gonna kill somebody.


1597
00:58:07,605 --> 00:58:07,625
Come on.


1598
00:58:07,625 --> 00:58:09,145
I'm not gonna hurt anybody.


1599
00:58:10,145 --> 00:58:13,745
Come this way. Just... No, no, no, no. You,
you, you good right here. They're putting


1600
00:58:13,765 --> 00:58:16,045
tape down. Just walk this way with me. You,
you can walk regular. Walk with me.


1601
00:58:16,145 --> 00:58:16,605
No.


1602
00:58:18,085 --> 00:58:20,945
I'm not moving unless somebody tells me to
move.


1603
00:58:21,245 --> 00:58:22,545
You can move. Come on.


1604
00:58:23,685 --> 00:58:24,445
How and where?


1605
00:58:24,465 --> 00:58:25,605
Just walk up to me.


1606
00:58:26,405 --> 00:58:27,945
How and where?


1607
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:29,185
In the regular walking


1608
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:29,905
r-


1609
00:58:29,905 --> 00:58:30,305
Go right around.


1610
00:58:30,325 --> 00:58:34,765
I'm not risking it. It's my best friend's
house and then my


1611
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:38,865
children are at the other house. It's like
less than a mile.


1612
00:58:38,885 --> 00:58:40,065
Okay, just... Okay, just walk this way with
us. Walk this way.


1613
00:58:40,065 --> 00:58:42,525
I'm not okay with it. You guys are [beep] .


1614
00:58:43,665 --> 00:58:48,145
It's a [beep] job. Tell me what I'm doing,
sir.


1615
00:58:48,165 --> 00:58:49,205
Walk towards me.


1616
00:58:49,205 --> 00:58:50,725
[cries]


1617
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:53,545
There we go. All right, that's fine. You can
stop. You can stop.


1618
00:58:55,345 --> 00:58:56,205
Let's take that here.


1619
00:58:56,205 --> 00:59:00,765
[crying] You guys are [beep]


1620
00:59:01,085 --> 00:59:03,625
jobs. You guys are so [beep] .


1621
00:59:06,265 --> 00:59:08,265
Hey, let me borrow your little, your little


1622
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:08,345
My what?


1623
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:09,265
D-U... Yeah.


1624
00:59:09,405 --> 00:59:09,605
Yeah.


1625
00:59:10,885 --> 00:59:15,685
Can I [beep] go home, bro? I have kids and my
husband.


1626
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:16,945
All right. Don't cry.


1627
00:59:16,945 --> 00:59:21,225
Like, no. I gotta go through this check
[crying] and this check-


1628
00:59:21,665 --> 00:59:22,625
And we have to make sure-


1629
00:59:22,625 --> 00:59:22,985
... and this check.


1630
00:59:22,985 --> 00:59:24,165
... make sure everything is okay.


1631
00:59:24,285 --> 00:59:26,745
Bro, I get home. I wanna go home.


1632
00:59:26,745 --> 00:59:29,765
Well, if everything goes well on this and we
see that you're okay to drive-


1633
00:59:29,865 --> 00:59:32,545
Obviously, dude, I've had the most-


1634
00:59:32,665 --> 00:59:32,825
Then that's-


1635
00:59:32,825 --> 00:59:33,865
... the most chill-


1636
00:59:34,525 --> 00:59:35,105
Yep, we're good. We're good.


1637
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:35,725
... like everything.


1638
00:59:35,725 --> 00:59:37,465
She's gonna start here in just a second,
okay?


1639
00:59:37,485 --> 00:59:38,085
Yeah, just a second.


1640
00:59:38,085 --> 00:59:41,165
I had the most chill ever- No, what do you
mean, dude?


1641
00:59:41,165 --> 00:59:43,305
They wouldn't have pulled me over for no
reason.


1642
00:59:43,325 --> 00:59:44,325
I mean, if everything goes well here then no.


1643
00:59:44,325 --> 00:59:46,345
You're lying, you're a liar.


1644
00:59:46,385 --> 00:59:47,865
If everything goes well, you're good. You're
all good.


1645
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:48,505
But you're a liar though.


1646
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:50,405
If you can show me that you are okay to
drive.


1647
00:59:50,405 --> 00:59:55,305
Because I've been in this situation where I
didn't have anything in the car and people


1648
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,505
have been like, "Oh, we're gonna take you to
jail anyways.


1649
00:59:58,505 --> 01:00:03,265
And then you have to do this, that, and the
other." [crying] And then people have [beep]


1650
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:03,745
taken


1651
01:00:04,365 --> 01:00:07,965
like completely innocent human beings away


1652
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:11,265
and taking them and so like, I'm scared.


1653
01:00:11,265 --> 01:00:11,305
Okay, so I, I'm-


1654
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:11,485
We're not taking them.


1655
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:14,105
Everybody's getting... I literally


1656
01:00:14,925 --> 01:00:16,365
just did that.


1657
01:00:16,585 --> 01:00:21,485
No, I asked you to move up to me. I told you,
I specifically said this is not a part of


1658
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:23,565
anything. Yeah, guys, okay. Whatever.


1659
01:00:23,765 --> 01:00:24,065
Here, put your clothes back on. Come here.
Let's work somewhere.


1660
01:00:24,065 --> 01:00:24,345
Okay, look. Right here.


1661
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:26,345
Whatever, guys. Okay. All right, guys.


1662
01:00:26,345 --> 01:00:26,805
Look, face me.


1663
01:00:26,865 --> 01:00:31,305
Get the [beep] out my face. You lie about me
doing your sobriety test.


1664
01:00:31,505 --> 01:00:31,705
You have-


1665
01:00:31,705 --> 01:00:34,045
Because I did your sobriety test.


1666
01:00:34,065 --> 01:00:34,805
So if you can stop your attitude right now
and do that.


1667
01:00:34,805 --> 01:00:36,765
I did it. Can you acknowledge her?


1668
01:00:36,845 --> 01:00:36,905
Or we'll


1669
01:00:36,905 --> 01:00:38,425
No, if you, if you, if you don't a-


1670
01:00:38,445 --> 01:00:40,645
Acknowledge her is sideways.


1671
01:00:40,645 --> 01:00:42,645
L- listen, you can listen to her. You can
listen to her.


1672
01:00:42,665 --> 01:00:45,245
I'm gonna go ahead and do whatever the [beep]
they tell me to do.


1673
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:49,625
[camera clicking] This is a grown woman who
somehow made it through life without learning


1674
01:00:49,725 --> 01:00:53,465
how a field sobriety test works. Talk about
being completely out of touch.


1675
01:00:53,545 --> 01:00:57,565
But nothing snaps you back to reality quite
like the cold click of handcuffs.


1676
01:00:57,745 --> 01:00:58,565
Place your feet


1677
01:00:59,445 --> 01:01:02,171
together and your arms by your side....


1678
01:01:02,171 --> 01:01:07,112
keep your head straight and follow the
stimulus with your eyes and your eyes only.


1679
01:01:07,131 --> 01:01:10,131
Do not move your head. Do you understand?


1680
01:01:10,911 --> 01:01:11,691
I do, sir.


1681
01:01:11,852 --> 01:01:12,511
Nice.


1682
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:16,692
Oh, wow. We're adding extra efficiency.


1683
01:01:16,751 --> 01:01:18,732
D- you said you understand the instructions,
but-


1684
01:01:19,111 --> 01:01:20,351
Turn that light off-


1685
01:01:20,451 --> 01:01:20,691
No-


1686
01:01:20,691 --> 01:01:24,951
... because my instructions don't include an
extra


1687
01:01:25,491 --> 01:01:28,572
LEO light on me. Do they?


1688
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:33,912
I'm gonna read this again. It says, "Follow
with your eyes and your eyes only, and do not


1689
01:01:33,951 --> 01:01:35,232
move your head. With your hands by your
side-"


1690
01:01:35,371 --> 01:01:37,232
Right, and, and that bitch-


1691
01:01:37,232 --> 01:01:38,112
"... and feet together."


1692
01:01:38,112 --> 01:01:39,092
... goes off.


1693
01:01:40,232 --> 01:01:40,511
No.


1694
01:01:40,552 --> 01:01:40,891
Right?


1695
01:01:41,171 --> 01:01:41,511
No.


1696
01:01:41,871 --> 01:01:42,311
No?


1697
01:01:43,171 --> 01:01:46,391
All right. Pull a judge out here. Tell me
what they think.


1698
01:01:47,271 --> 01:01:49,131
Well, you're not following instructions,
first of all.


1699
01:01:49,232 --> 01:01:52,871
My instructions involve a blue light-


1700
01:01:52,871 --> 01:01:53,491
... were to put your feet together, put your-


1701
01:01:53,491 --> 01:01:55,691
... in my face and not my [beep]


1702
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:58,291
Can put that light behind his back.


1703
01:01:58,311 --> 01:02:00,851
Put your feet together and hands by your
side.


1704
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,271
They've been here this whole time.


1705
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,491
Okay. And...


1706
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:04,811
Uh-huh.


1707
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:07,032
Follow with your eyes and your eyes only.


1708
01:02:07,032 --> 01:02:07,052
Uh-huh.


1709
01:02:07,052 --> 01:02:09,011
Do not move your head. It's not... Don't look
at me.


1710
01:02:09,011 --> 01:02:10,172
So until the light that's in my eyes-


1711
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:11,391
The light is not coming off


1712
01:02:11,391 --> 01:02:12,231
... from the background-


1713
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:13,391
The light is not coming off.


1714
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:18,412
The light from the background can go off,
otherwise I'll sue


1715
01:02:18,631 --> 01:02:20,891
you, you and you


1716
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:22,711
for the same thing.


1717
01:02:22,711 --> 01:02:23,072
Okay.


1718
01:02:23,211 --> 01:02:24,071
Turn it off.


1719
01:02:24,111 --> 01:02:26,112
So we're gonna just go to the next exercise.


1720
01:02:26,291 --> 01:02:28,492
No, we're gonna go ahead and go with the same
exercise-


1721
01:02:28,492 --> 01:02:31,472
No, 'cause I, I, I explained multiple times
you have not been listening


1722
01:02:31,472 --> 01:02:33,231
... and you are gonna turn that-


1723
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:34,151
Listen to me-


1724
01:02:34,151 --> 01:02:34,891
... light off?


1725
01:02:34,891 --> 01:02:35,711
Li- li- listen to me.


1726
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:36,011
Thank you.


1727
01:02:36,011 --> 01:02:38,731
I'm, I'm the one conducting the exercises.
I'm giving the instructions.


1728
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:43,011
Does the exercise say, "Side, side please


1729
01:02:43,252 --> 01:02:44,631
hold the light"?


1730
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:46,792
Are you gonna, are you gonna listen to me,
what I say?


1731
01:02:46,792 --> 01:02:48,591
"Side please hold the light."


1732
01:02:48,711 --> 01:02:49,331
Okay, look.


1733
01:02:50,851 --> 01:02:51,651
So s- s-


1734
01:02:51,651 --> 01:02:56,572
... or you're lying in my face one more
[beep] time, I'll sue you with the rest of


1735
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,391
them. Okay, I'm ready.


1736
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:00,171
Right for you, sir.


1737
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:01,071
Let's go. Let's go.


1738
01:03:01,891 --> 01:03:02,071
What do I need to-


1739
01:03:02,071 --> 01:03:04,391
Oh, we're gonna come up here to this line
right here.


1740
01:03:04,871 --> 01:03:05,311
Mm-hmm.


1741
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:07,211
Oh, oh. Okay.


1742
01:03:07,831 --> 01:03:08,711
All right. Yep.


1743
01:03:08,891 --> 01:03:10,891
You're gonna put your... You're gonna... A
lei.


1744
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:13,231
Mm-hmm. What else am I doing, honey?


1745
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:15,411
You're gonna place your left foot on the
line-


1746
01:03:15,791 --> 01:03:16,131
Mm-hmm


1747
01:03:16,131 --> 01:03:16,391
...


1748
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,251
and your right foot directly in front of it.


1749
01:03:19,611 --> 01:03:19,811
Left-


1750
01:03:19,811 --> 01:03:23,271
And my right foot directly in front of it
until the end of the line, right?


1751
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,551
Get the [beep] out my way.


1752
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:26,991
You listen to the instructions-


1753
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,711
Free my speech. Get the [beep] out my way.


1754
01:03:30,491 --> 01:03:31,911
Either listen to the instructions,


1755
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:33,771
or we just don't do it.


1756
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:36,351
Okay, let's listen to the instructions.


1757
01:03:36,351 --> 01:03:36,371
okay.


1758
01:03:36,371 --> 01:03:39,851
Get the [beep] out my way. And tell me the
instructions.


1759
01:03:40,331 --> 01:03:41,511
I'm telling you the instructions.


1760
01:03:41,771 --> 01:03:41,871
Get the fuck out my way.


1761
01:03:41,871 --> 01:03:46,391
Place your left foot on the line and your
right foot directly-


1762
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:47,671
Oh, my God. Let me call my husband.


1763
01:03:49,071 --> 01:03:49,691
Can I help you two?


1764
01:03:49,731 --> 01:03:50,031
Yeah.


1765
01:03:51,211 --> 01:03:51,511
Can I help you two?


1766
01:03:51,511 --> 01:03:52,571
Sir, please put your hands behind your back
for me.


1767
01:03:52,571 --> 01:03:53,571
I-


1768
01:03:53,671 --> 01:03:53,891
You're under arrest at this point, yes.


1769
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:53,951
No. No.


1770
01:03:53,971 --> 01:03:55,371
You resist, you're gonna have charges.


1771
01:03:55,471 --> 01:03:56,991
No, I'm not. I'm trying-


1772
01:03:57,011 --> 01:03:57,771
Yes, you are. No, you're not.


1773
01:03:57,911 --> 01:03:58,931
No, I'm not.


1774
01:03:59,011 --> 01:03:59,511
Okay. I got it here.


1775
01:03:59,511 --> 01:04:00,071
No, I'm not.


1776
01:04:00,371 --> 01:04:00,411
Relax.


1777
01:04:00,411 --> 01:04:01,711
I'm trying to call my husband.


1778
01:04:01,771 --> 01:04:02,671
Nope, you're under arrest at this point.


1779
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:04,331
And I'm trying to walk.


1780
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:06,411
I'm trying to walk.


1781
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:07,211
No. Give me your phone. Give me your phone.


1782
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:08,791
No, I'm trying to walk.


1783
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:12,651
I'm trying to walk. I'm trying to walk
without my husband.


1784
01:04:12,731 --> 01:04:12,951
He's-


1785
01:04:13,031 --> 01:04:13,651
Cool. You're in cuffs.


1786
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:17,771
I'm trying to walk without my husband. I'm
trying to walk. I hate you, bitch.


1787
01:04:18,451 --> 01:04:20,411
You have no [beep] idea.


1788
01:04:20,431 --> 01:04:20,731
Come on, girl.


1789
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:22,471
Thank you, I do, too, love.


1790
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,951
Give me my phone back. Right over there.


1791
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:25,691
How?


1792
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:27,351
How? How?


1793
01:04:28,751 --> 01:04:29,351
How? How?


1794
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:31,191
Grab her her handcuffs.


1795
01:04:31,671 --> 01:04:32,311
How?


1796
01:04:32,951 --> 01:04:35,611
You guys didn't give me any [beep] test.


1797
01:04:35,611 --> 01:04:36,411
Stop resisting.


1798
01:04:37,391 --> 01:04:38,451
Resisting?


1799
01:04:39,511 --> 01:04:40,371
Don't... Sorry.


1800
01:04:40,371 --> 01:04:43,471
I want my phone. Oh, my God, guys.


1801
01:04:43,471 --> 01:04:44,211
In the car. In the car.


1802
01:04:44,211 --> 01:04:46,311
Guys, I will do it if you speak to me.


1803
01:04:46,491 --> 01:04:48,171
No, you just plopped down when you did that.


1804
01:04:48,171 --> 01:04:49,571
Listen, you have no idea what you're doing.


1805
01:04:49,571 --> 01:04:49,911
The minor I have-


1806
01:04:49,911 --> 01:04:51,551
Get in. Get in the car. In the car.


1807
01:04:51,691 --> 01:04:52,431
What you're doing?


1808
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,171
Party driver on.


1809
01:04:53,291 --> 01:04:54,411
Please don't do this.


1810
01:04:54,471 --> 01:04:55,231
Yep, you're going up.


1811
01:04:55,411 --> 01:04:56,391
Please don't do this.


1812
01:04:56,391 --> 01:04:56,411
Have her hands behind her back.


1813
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:59,331
I'm, I'm going to get in and you guys are...


1814
01:04:59,331 --> 01:04:59,831
Are you guys-


1815
01:04:59,891 --> 01:05:01,451
No, you're not. You're sitting there as we're
pulling you in. Put it in.


1816
01:05:01,451 --> 01:05:02,991
I would like my phone in a-


1817
01:05:03,651 --> 01:05:04,171
She's got it.


1818
01:05:04,171 --> 01:05:05,071
You guys are kidding me.


1819
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:10,171
Her behavior keeps getting worse at the
station, to the point where the cops have no


1820
01:05:10,331 --> 01:05:15,171
choice but to step in harder. A quick breath
test shows exactly why she'd been


1821
01:05:15,231 --> 01:05:19,631
acting up. Her breath sample was 2.7 times
over the legal limit.


1822
01:05:19,691 --> 01:05:24,591
But being drunk doesn't give you a free pass
to act like a loud, out of control


1823
01:05:24,711 --> 01:05:25,151
mess.


1824
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:30,251
I didn't even get a chance to s- say [beep]
You have no right to


1825
01:05:30,271 --> 01:05:31,391
arrest me.


1826
01:05:33,411 --> 01:05:35,911
I was always available


1827
01:05:36,551 --> 01:05:41,471
to do the check-in and you guys had no [beep]
like


1828
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:44,511
point where you didn't all the way with me.


1829
01:05:45,871 --> 01:05:50,391
You guys didn't even do it. You guys didn't
even do a check-in with me.


1830
01:05:50,811 --> 01:05:53,671
What, you thought you were gonna smash my
face in the bar?


1831
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:54,571
No, I did not.


1832
01:05:54,731 --> 01:05:56,411
Is that what you thought you were gonna get?


1833
01:05:56,491 --> 01:05:58,911
No, you were resisting. That's why you not in
the seat of the car.


1834
01:05:58,911 --> 01:06:02,631
No, I didn't. I wasn't resisting. I said I
would take it.


1835
01:06:03,011 --> 01:06:04,791
I said, "Let me do it."


1836
01:06:05,431 --> 01:06:10,391
I said, "Let me do it." I said, "Let me give
the drunken


1837
01:06:10,751 --> 01:06:13,451
test." Let me do it.


1838
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,271
Let me do it. Now we live.


1839
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:17,291
That's for now. Hold on, let me see that. Oh,
yeah.


1840
01:06:18,151 --> 01:06:19,431
All of it and you didn't let me do it.


1841
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,611
You did... You, you did not cooperate.


1842
01:06:21,671 --> 01:06:23,271
You didn't let me do it.


1843
01:06:24,111 --> 01:06:25,371
You still haven't-


1844
01:06:26,011 --> 01:06:26,631
Well, it's, it's-


1845
01:06:26,631 --> 01:06:27,291
... let us do it.


1846
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:28,251
It's too late, now.


1847
01:06:28,271 --> 01:06:32,611
You won't let me... Oh, it's too late? You
can't let me be sober?


1848
01:06:33,311 --> 01:06:35,651
You're not allowed to let me be sober?


1849
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:41,591
You can't let me out of the car and do a
sobriety test and then let me


1850
01:06:41,671 --> 01:06:42,091
go?


1851
01:06:43,331 --> 01:06:44,431
You can't do that?


1852
01:06:46,171 --> 01:06:47,271
You can't do that?


1853
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:50,571
You didn't have the time?


1854
01:06:50,651 --> 01:06:51,811
My door, 458-


1855
01:06:51,811 --> 01:06:51,851
What's the problem?


1856
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,311
I'm 97LCJ65M.


1857
01:06:53,471 --> 01:06:56,511
What's the problem? Why couldn't you have
done the tests?


1858
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:57,171
Uh-huh.


1859
01:06:57,251 --> 01:07:01,011
Because you're gonna get sued. You're gonna
get [beep] sober.


1860
01:07:01,031 --> 01:07:02,271
78734.


1861
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:05,291
Yeah? You're gonna... You're not gonna do the
test?


1862
01:07:05,291 --> 01:07:05,971
Do you have a DNI?


1863
01:07:06,991 --> 01:07:11,809
You won't do the test?I


1864
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:12,149
didn't do anything.


1865
01:07:12,149 --> 01:07:12,289
Can you talk?


1866
01:07:12,289 --> 01:07:13,289
I didn't do anything.


1867
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:14,389
Can I talk?


1868
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:15,489
Yes, I would love to talk.


1869
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:16,589
Can I talk?


1870
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,109
I'd love to talk about everything.


1871
01:07:18,329 --> 01:07:18,349
No. Can I talk?


1872
01:07:18,349 --> 01:07:19,349
I'd love to talk about everything.


1873
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:20,449
I know you talked.


1874
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:22,650
Why is everybody holding me? What is going
on?


1875
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:23,909
Because you're piling up three people right
now.


1876
01:07:23,909 --> 01:07:27,069
Why is this happening? I didn't do anything
wrong.


1877
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:27,610
Rachel.


1878
01:07:28,009 --> 01:07:29,609
I wasn't even drunk enough-


1879
01:07:29,669 --> 01:07:30,209
Well, obviously having a little too much


1880
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:31,689
... to be pulled over and-


1881
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:33,069
It's false


1882
01:07:33,069 --> 01:07:34,070
... and to be-


1883
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:34,150
Calming. Shh.


1884
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,009
And to be like, be put aside-


1885
01:07:36,409 --> 01:07:36,689
Rachel, Rachel.


1886
01:07:36,689 --> 01:07:37,769
Whatever the word is.


1887
01:07:37,949 --> 01:07:38,589
Listen to me.


1888
01:07:38,589 --> 01:07:39,589
To be-


1889
01:07:39,689 --> 01:07:40,689
Listen to me


1890
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:41,789
... to be arrested.


1891
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:42,889
Listen to me.


1892
01:07:42,989 --> 01:07:43,989
I didn't do anything. [crying]


1893
01:07:44,089 --> 01:07:45,089
Get out of the way. Listen to me.


1894
01:07:45,189 --> 01:07:46,189
I didn't do anything.


1895
01:07:46,289 --> 01:07:47,289
Listen to me.


1896
01:07:47,389 --> 01:07:48,389
Good question.


1897
01:07:48,489 --> 01:07:49,489
My entire job here tonight-


1898
01:07:49,589 --> 01:07:50,589
So why is everybody taking-


1899
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:51,689
... my entire job


1900
01:07:51,789 --> 01:07:52,789
... my earrings out?


1901
01:07:52,889 --> 01:07:53,889
Listening.


1902
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:55,269
[cries] Why am I letting everybody take my
hair out and my earrings


1903
01:07:55,310 --> 01:07:58,230
out? What's going on? Why is this happening?


1904
01:07:58,330 --> 01:08:00,229
If you let me talk, I can share this with
you.


1905
01:08:00,269 --> 01:08:02,109
But then why have they told me?


1906
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:02,909
I'm trying.


1907
01:08:02,929 --> 01:08:03,170
Why-


1908
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,009
Keep talking.


1909
01:08:04,009 --> 01:08:04,990
Where's my other ear? [laughs]


1910
01:08:04,990 --> 01:08:06,649
You keep talking. I can't help.


1911
01:08:06,929 --> 01:08:11,889
What did I do wrong? I'm not psychotic to the
point where


1912
01:08:11,989 --> 01:08:15,749
you need to pull my earrings. You guys are
all nuts.


1913
01:08:16,629 --> 01:08:17,949
I did not do [beep] .


1914
01:08:19,389 --> 01:08:20,549
Why do you always think-


1915
01:08:21,089 --> 01:08:21,249
One ring.


1916
01:08:21,249 --> 01:08:22,249
All I did was being sick.


1917
01:08:22,349 --> 01:08:23,349
One ring.


1918
01:08:23,449 --> 01:08:24,449
Sure.


1919
01:08:24,549 --> 01:08:25,549
Gonna try and talk her.


1920
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:26,649
Thank you for securing me.


1921
01:08:26,749 --> 01:08:27,749
What did you want to just watch?


1922
01:08:27,849 --> 01:08:28,849
Rachel-


1923
01:08:28,949 --> 01:08:31,389
I am madly in love with her. I swear I would
never do anything to


1924
01:08:31,389 --> 01:08:36,309
hurt anybody on the police force, because I
respect the police force and


1925
01:08:36,309 --> 01:08:38,449
I appreciate what they do.


1926
01:08:38,889 --> 01:08:38,909
You're a waste of time.


1927
01:08:38,909 --> 01:08:39,909
That's not very nice.


1928
01:08:40,009 --> 01:08:40,309
Please help me. [cries]


1929
01:08:40,529 --> 01:08:42,309
Waste of time, trying to talk to them.


1930
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:43,229
I'm good. Oh, yeah.


1931
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:44,569
What's your name, Officer?


1932
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:46,989
My name is Senior Officer Parker with the
Police Department.


1933
01:08:47,029 --> 01:08:51,389
Officer Parker, finally. Eh, look at me
that's looking me


1934
01:08:51,869 --> 01:08:56,249
in my goddamn eyes and talking to me and tell
me what's going on.


1935
01:08:57,149 --> 01:09:00,109
Why the [beep] am I in this [beep] thing-


1936
01:09:00,469 --> 01:09:00,489
Calm down.


1937
01:09:00,489 --> 01:09:05,429
... when I am so cooperative? And why people
are trying


1938
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:10,369
to [beep] things off of me when I can pull my
own ring off


1939
01:09:10,389 --> 01:09:10,909
of me-


1940
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:11,209
I'm sorry.


1941
01:09:11,209 --> 01:09:13,649
... and give it to them. What the fuck is-


1942
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,729
[laughs] that's why.


1943
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:17,209
Rachel, from what I understand, you were
brought here-


1944
01:09:17,209 --> 01:09:17,889
What's her name?


1945
01:09:18,789 --> 01:09:19,609
You were brought here-


1946
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:20,669
I wanna know her name.


1947
01:09:20,769 --> 01:09:21,669
Okay, and-


1948
01:09:21,709 --> 01:09:21,729
Moore.


1949
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:23,189
Officer Parker, what's your name?


1950
01:09:24,009 --> 01:09:24,389
I, I-


1951
01:09:24,689 --> 01:09:24,969
Officer Moore.


1952
01:09:26,409 --> 01:09:26,949
Moore?


1953
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:27,389
Yes.


1954
01:09:28,929 --> 01:09:33,209
Rachel, Rachel, my job here is that, is to do
an


1955
01:09:33,229 --> 01:09:33,949
observation-


1956
01:09:34,169 --> 01:09:37,869
Officer Moore laughing at me while I'm trying
to explain-


1957
01:09:38,269 --> 01:09:38,289
Rachel-


1958
01:09:38,289 --> 01:09:40,549
... that I am completely cooperative.


1959
01:09:40,849 --> 01:09:45,629
And this bitch is laughing at me while I'm
cooperative and willing to work with


1960
01:09:45,669 --> 01:09:46,949
Officer Parker.


1961
01:09:47,689 --> 01:09:51,309
This bitch is fucking laughing at me. Could
someone remove her?


1962
01:09:51,809 --> 01:09:52,929
I tell you what, can we talk in the other
room?


1963
01:09:52,929 --> 01:09:54,689
And that bitch is laughing at me?


1964
01:09:54,769 --> 01:09:54,989
Oh my God! [laughs]


1965
01:09:55,009 --> 01:09:56,489
Rachel, can we talk in the other room?


1966
01:09:56,909 --> 01:10:00,049
I will remove myself. How loose are you?


1967
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:00,469
Look at her.


1968
01:10:00,469 --> 01:10:01,569
How loose are you?


1969
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:03,129
Rachel, can we talk in the other room?


1970
01:10:03,309 --> 01:10:04,489
How loose are you?


1971
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:09,269
Please? Like all of y'all, like I took, like
I had two


1972
01:10:09,409 --> 01:10:14,269

01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:19,629
shots in a-


1975
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:20,069
Calm down.


1976
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:22,509
... off the day trying to get [beep] up.


1977
01:10:22,509 --> 01:10:22,529
Calm down.


1978
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:24,389
Like why am I not-


1979
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:24,849
Calm down.


1980
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:28,369
Why am I not allowed to go pee if I have to
go pee if you guys...


1981
01:10:30,449 --> 01:10:31,049
I'm sorry.


1982
01:10:31,709 --> 01:10:32,329
Relax.


1983
01:10:32,589 --> 01:10:33,009
Hey.


1984
01:10:33,269 --> 01:10:34,169
Relax.


1985
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:34,729
Hey.


1986
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:38,269
Okay, we're gonna wait one minute and then
we're gonna do another sample, okay?


1987
01:10:40,369 --> 01:10:40,989
No.


1988
01:10:43,589 --> 01:10:44,289
I'm okay.


1989
01:10:46,069 --> 01:10:49,989
Three times for the mother- [beep] that
wanted Rachel to go to jail.


1990
01:10:50,169 --> 01:10:54,229
Hey, hey, hey. Three, two, one. [fingers
snapping]


1991
01:10:54,229 --> 01:10:55,049
You ready to blow?


1992
01:10:55,129 --> 01:10:55,829
I want one.


1993
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:57,069
You ready to blow?


1994
01:10:57,129 --> 01:10:57,149
Yeah.


1995
01:10:57,149 --> 01:10:59,149
Deep breath. Deep breath for me, Rachel.
Ready?


1996
01:10:59,349 --> 01:10:59,629
I wanna go home.


1997
01:10:59,629 --> 01:11:03,489
You have the right to an attorney and have
him or her present with you before and


1998
01:11:03,489 --> 01:11:04,369
during- I want Russell.


1999
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:07,529
... any questioning. Do you understand each
of these rights I have explained to you?


2000
01:11:07,549 --> 01:11:10,529
I passed every test. I did-


2001
01:11:10,529 --> 01:11:10,549
Do you know-


2002
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:11,849
... get zero questions.


2003
01:11:11,869 --> 01:11:12,189
Do you know-


2004
01:11:12,189 --> 01:11:16,909
Look at me. I passed every test.


2005
01:11:16,909 --> 01:11:17,769
Okay, can you listen?


2006
01:11:17,809 --> 01:11:19,509
Why am I sitting here-


2007
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:20,469
Okay, listen. Listen. Do you-


2008
01:11:20,469 --> 01:11:22,689
Why? Look at me.


2009
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:24,209
Do you understand your rights?


2010
01:11:24,229 --> 01:11:26,109
What's his name? W what?


2011
01:11:26,129 --> 01:11:28,349
That's it. Yeah, if you don't wanna talk,
then walk out.


2012
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:31,449
So I'll ask you, do you understand your
rights that I've explained to you?


2013
01:11:31,569 --> 01:11:34,249
I passed all of the tests.


2014
01:11:40,269 --> 01:11:41,629
Do you wanna try again or you good?


2015
01:11:42,489 --> 01:11:45,369
He made me pee myself. [beep] over here.


2016
01:11:45,649 --> 01:11:45,989
Do you want-


2017
01:11:45,989 --> 01:11:47,609
I just tried to hold myself so


2018
01:11:48,489 --> 01:11:48,889
bad.


2019
01:11:49,169 --> 01:11:53,789
We're done. She was charged with DUI and
resisting an officer without violence and


2020
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:57,569
refusal of DUI test after suspended license.


2021
01:11:57,629 --> 01:12:00,389
Unfortunately, she's not our worst suspect
today.


2022
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:02,669
Our last one takes that cake.


2023
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:05,129
Oh, fuck you. Go now.


2024
01:12:05,289 --> 01:12:06,189
Stay off me. What the hell?


2025
01:12:06,189 --> 01:12:07,769
Go [censored] now.


2026
01:12:07,889 --> 01:12:12,769
On February 13th, 2023, Florida officers were
called to a hospital where


2027
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:17,489
a woman was refusing to leave. When they
showed up, they were greeted by a loudmouth


2028
01:12:17,529 --> 01:12:20,109
whose meltdown could put a nuclear plant to
shame.


2029
01:12:21,549 --> 01:12:22,509
You're an [beep] .


2030
01:12:23,629 --> 01:12:24,469
What's going on?


2031
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:30,489
I love this. Oh my gosh! They just let them
see everything


2032
01:12:31,009 --> 01:12:32,329
that they shouldn't have seen.


2033
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:34,609
So [beep] you.


2034
01:12:34,669 --> 01:12:35,009
Whoa.


2035
01:12:35,009 --> 01:12:36,089
[beep] you.


2036
01:12:36,089 --> 01:12:37,669
Hey, I just got here. Relax.


2037
01:12:37,709 --> 01:12:37,749
And him.


2038
01:12:37,749 --> 01:12:38,529
You're making a scene.


2039
01:12:38,529 --> 01:12:39,289
[beep] you.


2040
01:12:39,309 --> 01:12:40,349
What are you making a scene for?


2041
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:41,329
[beep] you.


2042
01:12:41,389 --> 01:12:41,829
I'm good.


2043
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:43,049
She was too intoxicated.


2044
01:12:43,049 --> 01:12:43,589
Oh, is she?


2045
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:44,509
Get the [beep] out.


2046
01:12:44,509 --> 01:12:45,649
Who- who's she with?


2047
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,649
Go and see what they didn't see.


2048
01:12:48,209 --> 01:12:48,229
I didn't say anybody-


2049
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:51,689
Go and see what they didn't see! Go and see
what they didn't see!


2050
01:12:51,729 --> 01:12:52,749
Hey, how are you getting home?


2051
01:12:53,289 --> 01:12:53,789
Because you're a [beep] .


2052
01:12:54,249 --> 01:12:55,049
How are you getting home?


2053
01:12:55,289 --> 01:12:56,409
Oh, [beep] you.


2054
01:12:56,769 --> 01:12:57,389
How are you getting home?


2055
01:12:57,869 --> 01:12:59,969
Go and see what they didn't see.


2056
01:13:00,169 --> 01:13:00,409
Right there.


2057
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:01,129
How are you getting home?


2058
01:13:01,129 --> 01:13:03,489
Go now, now!


2059
01:13:04,529 --> 01:13:04,549
Go now!


2060
01:13:04,569 --> 01:13:05,749
How are you getting home?


2061
01:13:06,509 --> 01:13:06,989
Go


2062
01:13:07,589 --> 01:13:08,349
now!


2063
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:10,249
She's super intoxicated.


2064
01:13:11,129 --> 01:13:11,969
Go now!


2065
01:13:12,169 --> 01:13:13,009
What do you mean, see?


2066
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:16,344
... you. Go now.


2067
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,423
Hey, officer.


2068
01:13:17,423 --> 01:13:18,163
Go fucking now.


2069
01:13:18,163 --> 01:13:22,724
Ma'am, it is, it is on video. She just walked
in front of me. And she's very nice.


2070
01:13:22,724 --> 01:13:23,664
I would like to press charges.


2071
01:13:23,664 --> 01:13:25,564
Oh, oh, oh! Yes, you know this all. Sh- go-


2072
01:13:25,763 --> 01:13:26,584
My name's Spencer


2073
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:26,884
...


2074
01:13:27,563 --> 01:13:27,903
you.


2075
01:13:28,443 --> 01:13:30,264
Put your hands behind your


2076
01:13:30,264 --> 01:13:33,563
back.


2077
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:35,303
Are you f- kidding me?


2078
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:38,223
Are you f- kidding me?


2079
01:13:39,403 --> 01:13:40,043
Are you-


2080
01:13:40,063 --> 01:13:41,124
Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that.


2081
01:13:41,143 --> 01:13:42,744
Please arrest. Do not


2082
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:43,024
Are you f-


2083
01:13:43,883 --> 01:13:44,084
kidding me?


2084
01:13:44,084 --> 01:13:45,303
Stop. Put your hands behind your back.


2085
01:13:45,303 --> 01:13:45,823
Yeah, lay back.


2086
01:13:46,603 --> 01:13:50,524
You're f- kidding me. You're f- kidding me.


2087
01:13:50,903 --> 01:13:51,283
Ma'am.


2088
01:13:51,383 --> 01:13:53,343
Oh, oh, oh. Oh, hell no.


2089
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:53,703
Ma'am.


2090
01:13:54,003 --> 01:13:54,663
Hell no.


2091
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:58,663
Hell no.


2092
01:13:59,023 --> 01:13:59,363
I said,


2093
01:14:00,343 --> 01:14:01,143
I don't want you going home


2094
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:02,163
Hell no. Hell no.


2095
01:14:02,163 --> 01:14:02,323
Just listen to me. Just listen to me, ma'am.


2096
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:02,863
Hell no. Hell no.


2097
01:14:02,883 --> 01:14:03,604
I need you to listen to me for a second.
Ma'am. Go ahead. Go ahead and give it. You're


2098
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:03,703
fine. No.


2099
01:14:03,703 --> 01:14:04,163
She's tired.


2100
01:14:04,483 --> 01:14:07,143
Ma'am, from this point forward, you are
officially trespassing


2101
01:14:07,143 --> 01:14:08,764
Oh, you're funny. You're funny.


2102
01:14:08,764 --> 01:14:09,163
... the safety of our property.


2103
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:09,964
You're funny.


2104
01:14:09,964 --> 01:14:12,083
The only way you can come back to this
property-


2105
01:14:12,103 --> 01:14:13,943
You're funny. You're funny


2106
01:14:13,943 --> 01:14:14,623
... is if you're brought in by law
enforcement or medical emergency.


2107
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:15,703
You're funny. You're funny.


2108
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:16,143
Do you understand me?


2109
01:14:16,823 --> 01:14:18,683
You're funny. You're funny. Okay. You're
funny.


2110
01:14:20,903 --> 01:14:22,923
Well, we'll come get it. Just one second.


2111
01:14:22,923 --> 01:14:25,023
I have a lobby charge nurse if you need to
talk to her.


2112
01:14:25,023 --> 01:14:26,203
Yeah, we'll come with seven talks in a
second.


2113
01:14:28,003 --> 01:14:32,743
Oh, my God. You are f- kidding me. You are
not fucking kidding


2114
01:14:32,783 --> 01:14:35,023
me. You are f- kidding me.


2115
01:14:35,023 --> 01:14:36,823
Ma'am, do you have anything on you that we
need to write up?


2116
01:14:36,823 --> 01:14:38,463
Um, no, I don't.


2117
01:14:38,723 --> 01:14:39,783
All right. Anything found on you-


2118
01:14:39,783 --> 01:14:41,503
I don't. I have everything.


2119
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:41,583
Anything found on you


2120
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,503
No. I don't have anything!


2121
01:14:43,523 --> 01:14:44,103
You will have to swear that this can't-


2122
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:45,443
I don't have anything!


2123
01:14:45,443 --> 01:14:46,803
... be considered contraband that you will
then-


2124
01:14:46,803 --> 01:14:48,663
God. Shut the f- up!


2125
01:14:48,663 --> 01:14:49,403
I will not.


2126
01:14:49,863 --> 01:14:50,703
I don't have any f- thing in here.


2127
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:52,383
That's not freedom of speech.


2128
01:14:52,643 --> 01:14:55,343
Oh my God. F- you all.


2129
01:14:56,003 --> 01:15:00,843
F- you all. If you touch me more I'm gonna l-
need the 911.


2130
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:03,103
I'll tell you right now, it's a bad f- idea,
so stop.


2131
01:15:03,223 --> 01:15:05,203
Okay. Okay, you're touching me-


2132
01:15:05,303 --> 01:15:05,323
Thank you


2133
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:06,263
... way too much.


2134
01:15:06,963 --> 01:15:11,803
So touch... Ow! Touch me more like that.


2135
01:15:12,383 --> 01:15:13,543
No. You're a f-


2136
01:15:15,323 --> 01:15:15,343
idiot.


2137
01:15:15,363 --> 01:15:16,763
Go ahead and take a seat in my cruiser.


2138
01:15:17,003 --> 01:15:17,763
Oh, no. [laughs]


2139
01:15:18,163 --> 01:15:18,643
Have a seat.


2140
01:15:19,063 --> 01:15:19,083
Oh my God.


2141
01:15:19,143 --> 01:15:19,983
Put your feet in.


2142
01:15:20,383 --> 01:15:22,123
Oh, no. I'm not getting in here.


2143
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:23,123
Yes, ma'am, you are.


2144
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:24,103
No. No, I'm not.


2145
01:15:24,803 --> 01:15:25,843
Oh my...


2146
01:15:29,423 --> 01:15:30,983
Get in the vehicle now.


2147
01:15:31,603 --> 01:15:32,143
I don't want to.


2148
01:15:32,163 --> 01:15:34,103
You got battery on you. Stop.


2149
01:15:35,123 --> 01:15:35,983
Mm-mm. No.


2150
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:36,983
So now you just fucked up.


2151
01:15:36,983 --> 01:15:39,703
No. I am not. I am not. I am not!


2152
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:40,123
Stop.


2153
01:15:40,123 --> 01:15:40,843
F- get in there.


2154
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:44,523
Well, now you've just got a felony, so
congratulations. It's a great idea.


2155
01:15:45,423 --> 01:15:45,743
Come on,


2156
01:15:45,743 --> 01:15:46,643
My friend.


2157
01:15:46,823 --> 01:15:48,343
She's going to fight me again. Just get over.


2158
01:15:49,863 --> 01:15:50,343
Take it easy.


2159
01:15:50,343 --> 01:15:50,583
Yeah.


2160
01:15:51,803 --> 01:15:51,963
Yeah.


2161
01:15:52,303 --> 01:15:52,783
Because she's just


2162
01:15:53,003 --> 01:15:56,383
And everything is not coming down with the
police.


2163
01:15:56,903 --> 01:15:58,163
Stop doing that. Stop.


2164
01:15:58,483 --> 01:16:01,363
Fuck you. F- you. F- you.


2165
01:16:01,363 --> 01:16:02,363
Stop. Stop.


2166
01:16:02,463 --> 01:16:03,463
F- you. I will f- you.


2167
01:16:03,563 --> 01:16:04,563
Stop. Stop.


2168
01:16:04,663 --> 01:16:05,663
No, I will f- you.


2169
01:16:05,763 --> 01:16:06,763
Calm down.


2170
01:16:06,863 --> 01:16:07,863
Put your feet back down.


2171
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:08,963
I will f- you.


2172
01:16:09,063 --> 01:16:10,063
Put your feet back down.


2173
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:11,523
Stop.


2174
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:13,283
I will fuck you down.


2175
01:16:13,303 --> 01:16:15,723
Okay. I'm telling you right now, you're
making it worse for yourself. Stop.


2176
01:16:16,463 --> 01:16:16,663
Stop.


2177
01:16:16,663 --> 01:16:18,823
No. I'm following you down. I'm f-


2178
01:16:19,443 --> 01:16:19,983
you down.


2179
01:16:20,043 --> 01:16:20,383
Stop.


2180
01:16:20,483 --> 01:16:20,783
Now.


2181
01:16:20,783 --> 01:16:21,343
Calm down.


2182
01:16:21,783 --> 01:16:22,723
No, I'm not.


2183
01:16:22,983 --> 01:16:23,003
Calm down.


2184
01:16:23,003 --> 01:16:24,323
I'm f- you down.


2185
01:16:24,363 --> 01:16:24,903
Calm down.


2186
01:16:25,803 --> 01:16:26,723
F- you down.


2187
01:16:26,723 --> 01:16:27,203
Calm down.


2188
01:16:27,843 --> 01:16:28,663
You're an a- hole.


2189
01:16:28,663 --> 01:16:28,963
Calm down.


2190
01:16:30,123 --> 01:16:31,963
You're a f- hole.


2191
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,423
Put your feet back down. Stop.


2192
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:34,723
No. [laughs]


2193
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:35,183
Stop.


2194
01:16:35,243 --> 01:16:36,423
You're f- down.


2195
01:16:36,543 --> 01:16:37,043
Stop.


2196
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:38,643
I am down.


2197
01:16:39,043 --> 01:16:40,503
Ma'am, please put your feet down.


2198
01:16:40,523 --> 01:16:44,923
Apparently the woman had been visiting her
husband at the hospital and had caused a


2199
01:16:45,043 --> 01:16:49,683
ruckus instead. She was clearly drunk, but
her mother will also confirm her drinking


2200
01:16:49,763 --> 01:16:54,683
problem. But if you think her little show
outside the hospital was bad, wait until you


2201
01:16:54,783 --> 01:16:57,083
watch her take it up several notches in the
back of the cop car.


2202
01:16:57,143 --> 01:17:01,183
Uh, battery on hospital worker and then
battery Elio.


2203
01:17:01,503 --> 01:17:03,923
Along with resisting.


2204
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:04,423
Trespassed?


2205
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:06,423
Trespassed.


2206
01:17:06,443 --> 01:17:07,143
They totally...


2207
01:17:07,363 --> 01:17:07,523
Yeah. Yeah.


2208
01:17:07,523 --> 01:17:08,123
Did you just leave?


2209
01:17:08,483 --> 01:17:08,683
Yeah.


2210
01:17:09,103 --> 01:17:09,403
Okay.


2211
01:17:09,483 --> 01:17:14,323
This is an alcohol. This, I guess is a big
bottle if you could check it and say she's


2212
01:17:14,403 --> 01:17:15,423
sick pasted.


2213
01:17:17,243 --> 01:17:17,543
Oh my God.


2214
01:17:17,983 --> 01:17:19,663
No, ma'am, you're under arrest. You're going
to jail.


2215
01:17:21,803 --> 01:17:22,503
What's her ID?


2216
01:17:22,903 --> 01:17:24,223
Yeah, I got it right here.


2217
01:17:24,583 --> 01:17:24,643
Oh, shit.


2218
01:17:24,643 --> 01:17:25,403
Yeah. Cool.


2219
01:17:26,823 --> 01:17:31,523
This is the address and I take that address
as


2220
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:32,483
well, you know.


2221
01:17:33,103 --> 01:17:34,063
Menendez Drive...


2222
01:17:35,203 --> 01:17:39,103
That's the one we have right now. Okay, so
you already got her information.


2223
01:17:39,103 --> 01:17:39,523
The blue one.


2224
01:17:39,523 --> 01:17:39,583
I


2225
01:17:41,863 --> 01:17:42,723
appreciate it.


2226
01:17:43,383 --> 01:17:45,283
Where's the, uh,


2227
01:17:46,203 --> 01:17:48,903
the worker that was attacked by her?


2228
01:17:49,823 --> 01:17:50,903
The what now?


2229
01:17:51,003 --> 01:17:52,963
There's a worker that said he was attacked by
her.


2230
01:17:52,963 --> 01:17:53,243
She-


2231
01:17:53,323 --> 01:17:53,663
Yes. Uh-


2232
01:17:53,663 --> 01:17:53,963
She


2233
01:17:54,583 --> 01:17:55,323
pushed him.


2234
01:17:55,423 --> 01:17:57,003
Yeah, he had to, uh, subdue her to the
ground.


2235
01:17:57,583 --> 01:18:00,463
I'm gonna shine a light on him. You can just
bring him down just like that.


2236
01:18:01,343 --> 01:18:02,743
Can you raise your right hand real quick for
me?


2237
01:18:02,743 --> 01:18:04,543
[instrumental music plays] Do you swear for
me tell me the truth tonight?


2238
01:18:04,763 --> 01:18:05,263
Yes, sir.


2239
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,543
I appreciate it, man. Thank you.


2240
01:18:06,663 --> 01:18:07,803
Thank you all for taking us. Stay safe.


2241
01:18:07,803 --> 01:18:08,663
Hockey knuckle bump.


2242
01:18:08,843 --> 01:18:09,603
Okay. Yes, sir.


2243
01:18:09,883 --> 01:18:13,263
Thank you. Her purse is in the back. Um, this
is her daughter but we're gonna keep the


2244
01:18:13,383 --> 01:18:16,743
purse is in the back. Um, this is her
daughter but we're gonna keep the purse with


2245
01:18:16,843 --> 01:18:19,623
her. That's what the fire said. So all right.
The problem is she framed me with this. She


2246
01:18:19,723 --> 01:18:20,583
can't take this to jail, so... Oh, it's
pepper spray. Oh, yeah, pass her pepper


2247
01:18:21,003 --> 01:18:21,523
spray. Oh, yeah, pass her pepper spray. Sure.


2248
01:18:22,903 --> 01:18:25,743
See, she's already asleep. That's what she
does.


2249
01:18:25,943 --> 01:18:26,323
She's up.


2250
01:18:26,363 --> 01:18:28,863
She won't be a problem for anybody.


2251
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:29,183
Yeah.


2252
01:18:29,183 --> 01:18:31,083
Once she goes to sleep, she's fine.


2253
01:18:31,743 --> 01:18:35,483
Sheree. It's Mom. Sheree, baby. Wake up.


2254
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:36,403
What? What?


2255
01:18:36,403 --> 01:18:38,463
Mom. Sweetie. Look at me.


2256
01:18:38,523 --> 01:18:38,883
What?


2257
01:18:38,963 --> 01:18:39,663
Look at me.


2258
01:18:39,663 --> 01:18:40,083
What?


2259
01:18:41,003 --> 01:18:43,763
You have created an entire scene.


2260
01:18:44,743 --> 01:18:46,143
We're having to take you-


2261
01:18:47,183 --> 01:18:47,343
Oh, my God


2262
01:18:47,343 --> 01:18:49,723
... because you are drunk. You are drunk.


2263
01:18:49,843 --> 01:18:50,603
I'm not. I'm not.


2264
01:18:50,603 --> 01:18:53,203
And your hu- well, you're, you're in a police
car.


2265
01:18:53,303 --> 01:18:53,763
I'm not. I'm not.


2266
01:18:53,763 --> 01:18:55,643
You're in a police car, Sheree.


2267
01:18:56,663 --> 01:18:57,063
No, I'm not.


2268
01:18:57,183 --> 01:19:00,423
Yes, you are. What do you call this right
here? These are bars.


2269
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,583
I got two policemen standing right behind me.


2270
01:19:04,543 --> 01:19:07,023
They arrested you, felony charges.


2271
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:08,203
What?


2272
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:13,323
You have been arrested because I, because you
wouldn't say today, "Oh, Mom, get


2273
01:19:13,363 --> 01:19:18,206
over here, because I'm, I think I'm gonna
drink."So now we


2274
01:19:18,225 --> 01:19:19,045
got a problem.


2275
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:19,605
What's your problem?


2276
01:19:20,285 --> 01:19:22,565
So you better wake up and smell the coffee.


2277
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:26,126
I'm telling you young lady, I don't know what
else to say to you.


2278
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:28,105
This is ridiculous.


2279
01:19:29,205 --> 01:19:33,905
You hit somebody! They filed charges against
you.


2280
01:19:34,465 --> 01:19:34,765
What?


2281
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,685
I'm telling you, she just, she doesn't know.


2282
01:19:37,785 --> 01:19:38,925
She is like-


2283
01:19:39,005 --> 01:19:39,105
Hmm.


2284
01:19:39,225 --> 01:19:43,505
When she's up, when she... What she does is
she goes to sleep and then she's fine.


2285
01:19:44,985 --> 01:19:48,285
You know what, I don't even drink. [laughs]
How did I end up with child support?


2286
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:50,866
Oh my gosh. No, we are not.


2287
01:19:51,346 --> 01:19:52,425
I don't even get it.


2288
01:19:52,425 --> 01:19:54,265
That's the-


2289
01:19:54,265 --> 01:19:55,285
It, it just happened so quickly.


2290
01:19:55,605 --> 01:20:00,026
That's the thing is that [sighs] when
somebody becomes an adult they make their own


2291
01:20:00,026 --> 01:20:01,066
decisions and they're responsible for them.


2292
01:20:01,066 --> 01:20:02,985
And when they do, and you're, you're talking
to an old counselor who


2293
01:20:03,105 --> 01:20:05,066
Please tell me this is a joke.


2294
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:06,066
Uh-


2295
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:07,166
[laughs]


2296
01:20:07,266 --> 01:20:08,266
No, no.


2297
01:20:08,366 --> 01:20:09,366
Please tell me this is a joke.


2298
01:20:09,466 --> 01:20:10,525
But, I do... I am kicking myself because when
she called and said he was here,


2299
01:20:10,785 --> 01:20:14,345
I said, "Well, just tell me if..." Because
he's had pancreatitis and I said-


2300
01:20:14,366 --> 01:20:14,945
Her, her husband.


2301
01:20:14,945 --> 01:20:15,265
Her husband.


2302
01:20:15,265 --> 01:20:16,405
Yes. Please tell me this is a joke.


2303
01:20:16,405 --> 01:20:21,225
But nobody called. And so I kept thinking,
"Well, she's all right and they'll have her


2304
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:23,445
call." Now please tell me this is a joke.


2305
01:20:23,585 --> 01:20:25,145
All right. Well, we're gonna get out of here.


2306
01:20:25,245 --> 01:20:25,365
Okay.


2307
01:20:25,645 --> 01:20:26,705
I need your phone.


2308
01:20:27,605 --> 01:20:31,685
Please tell me you didn't call the police and
let me go and


2309
01:20:32,665 --> 01:20:33,765
take care of my husband.


2310
01:20:35,025 --> 01:20:35,945
I'm begging you.


2311
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:37,085
No, ma'am.


2312
01:20:38,125 --> 01:20:39,065
You're going to jail.


2313
01:20:39,645 --> 01:20:39,705
Oh no.


2314
01:20:39,705 --> 01:20:40,585
You committed a crime.


2315
01:20:40,585 --> 01:20:41,865
Why am I going to jail?


2316
01:20:42,045 --> 01:20:43,165
You committed a crime.


2317
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,065
I didn't commit a crime.


2318
01:20:45,145 --> 01:20:45,825
Yes, you did.


2319
01:20:46,365 --> 01:20:47,425
No, I didn't.


2320
01:20:47,765 --> 01:20:49,505
There's video footage of all of it.


2321
01:20:50,505 --> 01:20:52,545
Oh my gosh. What is it?


2322
01:20:52,625 --> 01:20:57,485
You kicked an officer twice and then you
grabbed one of the nurses inside of the


2323
01:20:57,485 --> 01:20:59,045
hospital. Those are both crimes.


2324
01:20:59,525 --> 01:21:00,345
What do you mean I did that?


2325
01:21:00,345 --> 01:21:04,065
Along with that, you refused to leave the
hospital after being instructed to do so.


2326
01:21:04,705 --> 01:21:05,865
I did not do that.


2327
01:21:06,265 --> 01:21:06,945
All righty.


2328
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:10,885
You kicked your shoes off. I'll make sure
those come inside with you.


2329
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:12,885
Excuse me?


2330
01:21:13,945 --> 01:21:14,745
Your shoes.


2331
01:21:15,605 --> 01:21:15,705
For real?


2332
01:21:15,725 --> 01:21:17,785
Miss Sherry, go ahead and step out of the
vehicle for me.


2333
01:21:17,985 --> 01:21:19,825
No. You have got to be kidding me.


2334
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:22,165
Step out of the vehicle now.


2335
01:21:28,125 --> 01:21:29,565
Are you kidding? You're kidding, right?


2336
01:21:29,745 --> 01:21:33,005
No, ma'am. You're in jail now. Step out of
the vehicle.


2337
01:21:34,365 --> 01:21:34,785
I am not going to fucking jail.


2338
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:37,545
Step out of the vehicle or I'm gonna remove
you from the vehicle.


2339
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:40,945
Get out of the vehicle.


2340
01:21:40,945 --> 01:21:41,245
Oh, oh-


2341
01:21:41,265 --> 01:21:41,485
Come on.


2342
01:21:41,485 --> 01:21:42,565
Oh my God. Just...


2343
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:43,585
Come on.


2344
01:21:44,945 --> 01:21:48,745
Oh my God. Oh my God! What are you doing?


2345
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:50,385
Literally not like...


2346
01:21:51,905 --> 01:21:53,865
Please, please tell me you're not-


2347
01:21:53,885 --> 01:21:54,705
Take a seat.


2348
01:21:54,985 --> 01:21:59,725
You would think that setting foot in the
hospital would make her act sane, but this


2349
01:21:59,805 --> 01:22:03,805
woman still can't believe that being drunk
and disorderly has consequences.


2350
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:05,625
Trespass battery elliott.


2351
01:22:06,385 --> 01:22:07,965
Battery on hospital personnel.


2352
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:13,585
You are such a bitch. No one, no one, no
one... You know what you are?


2353
01:22:14,485 --> 01:22:15,585
You know what you are?


2354
01:22:16,405 --> 01:22:17,685
I mean, you're hot.


2355
01:22:21,125 --> 01:22:23,145
No, you know what he's doing.


2356
01:22:23,765 --> 01:22:25,465
You know what you're doing.


2357
01:22:27,185 --> 01:22:28,745
You know what you're doing.


2358
01:22:29,585 --> 01:22:33,565
So yeah, that's my expensive bag. [laughs]


2359
01:22:33,805 --> 01:22:35,785
It's gonna go in your property here at the
jail.


2360
01:22:36,505 --> 01:22:37,885
Oh, hell no.


2361
01:22:39,145 --> 01:22:39,345
Hell yes.


2362
01:22:39,365 --> 01:22:40,645
Oh, hell no.


2363
01:22:41,305 --> 01:22:41,585
Yep.


2364
01:22:41,785 --> 01:22:43,005
Oh, that's like a


2365
01:22:43,805 --> 01:22:45,045
$1400


2366
01:22:45,765 --> 01:22:50,665
bag. You almost stole it. Y'all thought that
was all mine.


2367
01:22:50,985 --> 01:22:52,825
Okay, give me that shit.


2368
01:22:53,925 --> 01:22:54,485
No, ma'am.


2369
01:22:55,405 --> 01:22:57,165
Ooh, it's so pretty.


2370
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:00,165
How pretty are you?


2371
01:23:01,185 --> 01:23:06,125
Ma'am, I don't, I don't care anything that
you have to say at this point.


2372
01:23:07,445 --> 01:23:08,945
You're in jail, you're under arrest.


2373
01:23:10,345 --> 01:23:10,505
So-


2374
01:23:11,585 --> 01:23:15,665
I'm good. If you touch me I will knock the
shit out of you.


2375
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,585
Are you threatening me right now?


2376
01:23:18,205 --> 01:23:20,605
Yeah, I will knock the shit out of you.


2377
01:23:21,385 --> 01:23:22,765
You will knock the shit out of me?


2378
01:23:22,785 --> 01:23:24,745
Yes, I will. [laughs]


2379
01:23:24,745 --> 01:23:27,085
All right. I'll make sure the judge sees
that.


2380
01:23:27,445 --> 01:23:31,085
Oh, really? So y'all don't even care about
that shit?


2381
01:23:31,645 --> 01:23:35,125
What? Care about what? You the one that
brought him down here. Who put it?


2382
01:23:35,325 --> 01:23:37,385
You already did 1/2 a day before.


2383
01:23:39,125 --> 01:23:42,425
Oh my God. No. I, I am done with this shit.


2384
01:23:42,885 --> 01:23:44,985
My husband is here for me.


2385
01:23:45,945 --> 01:23:47,445
Get this shit off of me.


2386
01:23:48,645 --> 01:23:50,425
Get this shit off of me.


2387
01:23:50,765 --> 01:23:51,025
Mm-hmm.


2388
01:23:51,205 --> 01:23:53,245
My husband is here for me.


2389
01:23:53,425 --> 01:23:55,085
He's not here, he's in the hospital.


2390
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:59,185
Yes... No, my husband is here for me. Get
this shit off of me.


2391
01:23:59,185 --> 01:23:59,985
Take a seat.


2392
01:24:00,405 --> 01:24:02,265
Get this shit off of me.


2393
01:24:02,725 --> 01:24:03,685
Sit back down.


2394
01:24:03,685 --> 01:24:09,325
[laughs]


2395
01:24:09,325 --> 01:24:09,465
I said, "Sit the bitch down." [laughs]


2396
01:24:10,125 --> 01:24:12,405
Oh, you expect me to go and do that?


2397
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:13,585
Yes, ma'am.


2398
01:24:14,365 --> 01:24:16,325
No. Get this shit off of me.


2399
01:24:16,605 --> 01:24:18,385
They'll take your handcuffs off, I'm not.


2400
01:24:19,345 --> 01:24:23,605
Get this shit off of me. Why are y'all such


2401
01:24:23,865 --> 01:24:25,445
fucking cows?


2402
01:24:26,965 --> 01:24:29,925
You are such fucking cows. No,


2403
01:24:30,825 --> 01:24:31,225
no.


2404
01:24:32,645 --> 01:24:33,785
Oh, oh, oh, help me-


2405
01:24:33,785 --> 01:24:34,745
Take a seat.


2406
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:35,385
Help. Help me up.


2407
01:24:35,385 --> 01:24:36,725
You're not getting back up.


2408
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:38,265
Oh, fuck you.


2409
01:24:38,285 --> 01:24:39,505
You're gonna stay down.


2410
01:24:39,665 --> 01:24:43,385
Fuck you, get your fuck off of my shit.


2411
01:24:43,385 --> 01:24:45,085
[punching sounds] Oh my God.


2412
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,325
Do not kick me.


2413
01:24:47,365 --> 01:24:49,325
Do not kick me, do you understand?


2414
01:24:49,805 --> 01:24:50,925
I'ma help you up now.


2415
01:24:51,725 --> 01:24:52,365
Get up.


2416
01:24:52,365 --> 01:24:54,905
[bleep] I'm not going to


2417
01:25:01,105 --> 01:25:01,525
jail.


2418
01:25:01,545 --> 01:25:03,765
You are. The officer said King County Jail.


2419
01:25:04,065 --> 01:25:05,685
I am not in jail.


2420
01:25:06,265 --> 01:25:07,385
We're not at the Hilton's.


2421
01:25:08,305 --> 01:25:10,065
I'm not in jail.


2422
01:25:10,425 --> 01:25:11,305
Yeah, you are.


2423
01:25:12,725 --> 01:25:14,685
Okay. Please stop.


2424
01:25:15,485 --> 01:25:17,785
I'm about to take the ring off. I can't have
you hearing-


2425
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:19,745
Please stop!


2426
01:25:19,765 --> 01:25:20,285
Oh, God.


2427
01:25:22,245 --> 01:25:24,725
Here we go. Just chill out.


2428
01:25:26,565 --> 01:25:31,305
No, ma'am. No, ma'am. I've never been through
this before.


2429
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:36,565
Oh my gosh. You got like a huge guy over
there.


2430
01:25:37,145 --> 01:25:38,305
Oh my gosh.


2431
01:25:39,905 --> 01:25:40,705
Are you married?


2432
01:25:41,505 --> 01:25:43,185
No, I am not married.


2433
01:25:43,885 --> 01:25:45,785
I am scared now.


2434
01:25:45,985 --> 01:25:47,445
What? What does he doing


2435
01:25:48,505 --> 01:25:48,785
here?


2436
01:25:48,785 --> 01:25:49,365
I don't know.


2437
01:25:51,125 --> 01:25:51,365
Okay.


2438
01:25:51,365 --> 01:25:52,685
What is he doing here?


2439
01:25:53,645 --> 01:25:56,405
Did everything correctly on this? Yes, ma'am.


2440
01:25:56,585 --> 01:26:01,525
She was charged with battery, trespassing,
disturbing the peace and resisting an


2441
01:26:01,665 --> 01:26:04,905
officer. Do you think these suspects had it
