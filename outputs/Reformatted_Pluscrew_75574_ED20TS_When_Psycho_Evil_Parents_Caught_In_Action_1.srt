1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:03,299
So, he's gonna have custody of my [censored]
baby?


2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:06,520
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow!


3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,419
Some parents just don't know how to parent.


4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,899
Today, we'll uncover a few of the most
disturbing moments caught on police body cam,


5
00:00:14,019 --> 00:00:18,819
where parents' actions left a trail of chaos,
fear, and danger for their


6
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:19,559
own children.


7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,700
I've worked so hard, man.


8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:24,579
Well, you gotta make better decisions, dude.
I don't care how hard you work.


9
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:29,699
From neglectful parents to downright violent
ones, these stories will make you question


10
00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:31,639
what some people are capable of. Stay tuned.


11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,379
Are you okay?


12
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:33,420
[crying] I took a little bit, like, I don't
know-


13
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:34,460
Took a little bit of what?


14
00:00:35,279 --> 00:00:35,700
It's just nervous, so-


15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:35,720
Oh, [censored] .


16
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,019
The kid doesn't need to see this.


17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,860
I was sleeping, man. I don't know what you
guys want from me.


18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:39,959
Well, I just want the truth.


19
00:00:40,139 --> 00:00:42,759
Many things have put these kids' lives in
danger today. Not just one thing.


20
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:47,639
Today, we have Detective Dale here to walk us
through five intense and harrowing cases


21
00:00:47,739 --> 00:00:50,880
where officers arrived at the scene just in
time. Let's dive in.


22
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,159
I want to see my baby! That's all I want!


23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:00,199
On August 3rd, 2024, in Ohio, officers rushed
to the scene


24
00:01:00,319 --> 00:01:05,279
after getting a call about a heated fight
between a couple that quickly got out of


25
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:07,059
hand. Hold on, hold on. Where is she at?
Where is she at?


26
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:07,859
In the basement.


27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,119
Lead us to her.


28
00:01:09,179 --> 00:01:10,879
Get out of my house!


29
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:15,999
Stay right here. Stop. When the officers
arrived, the man was visibly shaken and fed


30
00:01:16,059 --> 00:01:20,079
up. He told officers the suspect was
upstairs, acting out of control.


31
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,059
Under the influence after days of non-stop
use, despite his desperate pleas for


32
00:01:25,059 --> 00:01:29,839
her to stop. She had taken his truck without
permission, and now this was the third time


33
00:01:30,019 --> 00:01:34,879
she had turned violent. He made it clear that
he wanted her arrested, but before the


34
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:37,419
officers went up, he warned them she was
going to lie.


35
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:42,179
Do you think the officers will be able to
handle someone this unpredictable?


36
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:44,799
What's going on, brother?


37
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:44,979
There's


38
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,259
a woman upstairs.


39
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:46,839
Okay.


40
00:01:48,819 --> 00:01:49,679
Well, what happened, man?


41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,119
She's on bars. And she's extremely [censored]
up.


42
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:53,899
All right.


43
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:58,519
She's driving intoxicated right now. You'll
see it as soon as you look in her eyes.


44
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:03,499
She has my truck. Yes, she bought it, but
it's in my name, so technically that's my


45
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,179
truck, right?


46
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:04,919
You guys are married?


47
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:05,379
No.


48
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:05,999
No?


49
00:02:06,139 --> 00:02:06,219
No.


50
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:07,419
Have you guys lived together for a while?


51
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:07,659
Yeah.


52
00:02:07,839 --> 00:02:08,679
You got kids together?


53
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:08,979
Yeah.


54
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:09,639
Okay.


55
00:02:09,659 --> 00:02:10,599
But even... [clears throat]


56
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:12,399
By law, it's actually both of your trucks.


57
00:02:13,139 --> 00:02:14,739
But it's in m- my name.


58
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:20,559
In Ohio, that doesn't matter. If, if you're,
uh, in, like, a common law relationship-


59
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:21,179
Well-


60
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:24,759
... which is basically you guys have lived
together for a while, you have kids together,


61
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:25,139
you guys have lived together for a while, you
have kids together, you know, all that sort


62
00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:26,799
of jazz.. Well, I have two kids in the house-


63
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:27,199
Mm-hmm


64
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,959
... and she's being like that in front of two
kids.


65
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:29,919
I definitely get it, man.


66
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,939
She's on her third domestic violence charge.
I would like her to go to jail tonight for


67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,679
domestic violence charge. I would like her to
go to jail tonight for domestic violence.


68
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:41,419
Okay, yeah. We'll try and find her, uh... And
before you get here, she's gonna say that I


69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,279
kicked this bookshelf over, which I didn't.
And I have my 13-year-old daught- my


70
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:49,359
12-year-old daughter in here that can come
down here and tell you the exact same thing.


71
00:02:49,359 --> 00:02:49,979
But I'm not bull- [censored] . I live right
here. Yes, I see.


72
00:02:50,119 --> 00:02:50,519
Okay.


73
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:52,019
Yeah. You got a red mark in there.


74
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:57,359
And she's gonna tell you that, uh, I put my
hands on her, and my daughter will definitely


75
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:57,699
tell you that, uh, I put my hands on her, and
my daughter will definitely tell you, no, I


76
00:02:58,199 --> 00:03:01,039
did not. So, tell me what happened tonight.
Tell me, like, a, like, a story, like...


77
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:05,799
Uh, I've been trying to get her to stop
eating Xanaxes for


78
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:06,679
three days.


79
00:03:07,299 --> 00:03:12,079
She said she was going down to her grandma's
to do something, which she went and got more


80
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,139
Xanaxes.


81
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:18,799
Then she said she was gonna go do something,
then she went and got more Xanaxes and then


82
00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:23,599
hid them from me. And when I told her it was
either the Xanaxes or me, she


83
00:03:23,619 --> 00:03:28,439
went irate. Like I said, I can show you the
bookshelf that she kicked over.


84
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:28,859
Mm-hmm.


85
00:03:29,259 --> 00:03:30,699
What's today? Saturday?


86
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:31,219
Yeah.


87
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:35,899
Oh, yeah, she'll be in there all weekend.
Yeah, I definitely want her in jail for


88
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,059
domestic violence. Okay. Um, do you know
where she might be going?


89
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,339
No, she's running around hiding from you
guys.


90
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:45,519
And if she does happen to go to jail, is
there any way you can possibly get my keys


91
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,759
and bring them to me? Yeah, if we, uh, if we
get her, um, we'll give you a call and then-


92
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,479
Because I have two sleeping keys in the hou-
kids in the house. I can't get to 'em.


93
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:57,839
We could drive the keys back to you. We could
probably, like, park it somewhere and then


94
00:03:57,839 --> 00:04:01,599
drive the keys back to you. We could

00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:25,239

house and then you'll just go get the car


130
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:25,919
later if you need to. I mean, you can, you
throw 'em right in the back seat of that car.


131
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:28,039
I mean, you can, you throw 'em right in the
back seat of that car. I don't care. Okay.


132
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:28,859
She thought I was playing, but I'm not. This
is the third time she's put her hands on me,


133
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:32,319
and any man, even you, I know you're a cop,
but if a female puts her hands on you three


134
00:05:32,359 --> 00:05:32,599
times very violently, you're gonna, you're
gonna do something, right? Right. The next


135
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,139
morning, when officers returned to arrest
her, they found it wasn't just herself she


136
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:38,679
was putting in danger. Things had gotten
extreme. Hey, man, where's she at? Still back


137
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,959
at it. Where's she at, though? Right now?
Hold on, hold on. Where's she at? Where is


138
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:42,079
she at, though? Right now? Hold on, hold on.
Where's she at? Where is she at, though?


139
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,039
Right now? Hold on, hold on. Where's she at?
Where is she at, though? Right now? Hold on,


140
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,339
hold on. Where's she at? Where is she at,
though? Right now? Hold on, hold on. Where's


141
00:05:44,339 --> 00:05:46,679
she at? Where is she at, though? Right now?
Hold on, hold on. Where's she at? Where is
she at? Where is she at, though? Right now? H


142
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,219
old on, hold on. Where's she at? Where is she
at? In the basement. Lead us to her. You


143
00:05:48,239 --> 00:05:48,459
don't have any weapons inside, do you? I
mean, yes, but none on us. Okay. I don't- Do


144
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:49,399
you have any dogs? Uh, out back. They're out
back? But- They're not inside? No, but


145
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:50,579
apparently I'm the one going to jail 'cause
I'm the aggressor. Well, we'll deal with


146
00:05:50,579 --> 00:05:52,619
that. We'll deal with that in a second,
buddy. I know, I know. Okay. She doesn't have


147
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:53,159
any weapons in the basement. She has access
to the- Hey, Destiny? Yes? What's going on?


148
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:53,919
Okay, so he will not leave me alone. Okay.
I'm sorry, I'll try- Who's he to you? Um, he


149
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,939
is my fiance, so this is- Okay ... why I
don't want to... Be careful with my boobs.


150
00:05:55,999 --> 00:06:00,779
So, this is what, um, he did to me. Um, it's
kind of easier to take it off. That's okay.


151
00:06:00,799 --> 00:06:02,019
We can, we can deal with that with the medic.
Just- Yeah, yeah. We have a medic waiting for


152
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:02,859
you. Keep your shirt on right now, okay?
Okay, you can see right here, the bruise.


153
00:06:02,859 --> 00:06:03,739
Okay. Oh, my God, it hurts so bad. It's just
on your bruise? Okay. Um, he's... Like, my


154
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:04,019
legs right here. Okay. Um, uh- Okay, go ahead
and put your cigarette out, okay? I'm sorry.


155
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:05,679
The, the back of my leg right here. Hold on,
baby. I know, I know. Come here, come here,


156
00:06:05,679 --> 00:06:07,239
come here, come here. Hold on, hold on, hold
on. Wait, wait, wait. Here we go. Hold on,


157
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:07,279
hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. Here we
go. Hold on, hold on. Eh, it's okay. Let's


158
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,739
just get this off of here. You're gonna be c-
handcuffs right now, okay? No! Just while


159
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:11,341
we're figuring things out. But he's the one
who attacked me. [baby cries]


160
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,081
W- we'll get that.


161
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:12,921
We'll get it, okay? We'll get it in a minute.


162
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:14,042
Can I get a drink, please, first?


163
00:06:14,101 --> 00:06:14,621
What? Go ahead.


164
00:06:14,621 --> 00:06:15,261
Take a drink.


165
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,361
Maria, take a drink and then we're gonna
explain this to you.


166
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:17,381
[baby crying]


167
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,361
Yeah, set that down. Set that down.


168
00:06:21,701 --> 00:06:22,781
You see my badge, right?


169
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:23,281
Yeah.


170
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:25,161
See how I lit, right?


171
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:25,602
Yeah.


172
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,781
All right, we had an accident yesterday and
it's all in the report.


173
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:32,082
All her marks are from the accident, but she
says was from me.


174
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:34,221
She's highly intoxicated.


175
00:06:34,402 --> 00:06:35,001
On what?


176
00:06:35,421 --> 00:06:37,721
Xanaxes. And if you look at her, you could
tell.


177
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,541
Okay. Did you smoke any marijuana tonight
too?


178
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,061
Yeah, I smoked marijuana, yes.


179
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:45,402
Oh, I don't- I don't care about it. I was
just wondering if she did as well.


180
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:46,301
Yeah. No. All she's-

184

Can I please put everything in my purse,
please?


185
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:54,541
Just stop. [baby cries]


186
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,041
I don't want him to have anything in my
purse, please.


187
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:58,682
Okay. We'll deal with that, but in the
meantime, hold still.


188
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:01,662
No, no, no. I'm sorry. My fingering thing on
my pinky looks like they're gonna take it


189
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:02,922
away. There you go. Hold still.


190
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:04,741
Ow, ow. Okay, okay, just like this?


191
00:07:04,741 --> 00:07:06,581
That's, that's why I say yeah, there you go.


192
00:07:06,601 --> 00:07:10,181
Okay. Can you please put my purse, uh, my
phone in my purse?


193
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:10,542
Oh, yeah.


194
00:07:10,542 --> 00:07:14,601
Officers took her into custody, but do you
think the story just ends here?


195
00:07:14,822 --> 00:07:15,681
Definitely not.


196
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:18,042
Hey, Jessie. Will you talk to this officer
for me?


197
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:21,082
This is the other per- This is the other-
Give it to him, okay?


198
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:24,881
The cops are here and I need you to explain
exactly what's going on.


199
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:28,461
Can my baby please not stay with him? He's
very violent.


200
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,121
Well, he's D- he's dad, right?


201
00:07:30,301 --> 00:07:30,601
Yes, but I-


202
00:07:30,601 --> 00:07:31,601
He's the biological dad?


203
00:07:31,902 --> 00:07:34,881
Yes, but I have five other people ready to
come get her.


204
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:35,321
Okay.


205
00:07:35,661 --> 00:07:37,502
Okay. Well, we're gonna figure that out in a
minute, okay?


206
00:07:37,821 --> 00:07:39,141
Okay. Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.


207
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:40,181
Okay. Is that her stuff? [phone rings]


208
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:40,481
Yep.


209
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,142
Keep walking. Keep walking.


210
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:46,621
Oh, God. Oh, G- Oh, God. We just had physical
therapy on our backs-


211
00:07:46,661 --> 00:07:46,681
Yep


212
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:50,682
... like, for eight days in a row and, like,
we got some big settlement and, like-


213
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:51,141
Okay


214
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,562
... a company truck hit us.


215
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:53,282
Okay.


216
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:54,922
Oh, I can't... Can you help me? I'm sorry.


217
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:55,761
Yep. Keep going.


218
00:07:55,941 --> 00:07:56,741
Okay. Oh, God. Oh, my God.


219
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:57,461
I got you.


220
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,622
Oh, my gosh. Okay.


221
00:07:59,082 --> 00:08:00,741
There you go. Come over this way, ma'am.


222
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:02,201
Can I see number one sec?


223
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,121
Nope. We're gonna keep moving. Come on.


224
00:08:04,161 --> 00:08:04,442
Okay.


225
00:08:04,541 --> 00:08:06,881
Because we have a seat for you and we want to
get you checked out, okay?


226
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:09,641
Yeah, thanks a lot for you beating my ass.


227
00:08:09,641 --> 00:08:10,541
We're gonna have lunch.


228
00:08:10,561 --> 00:08:13,841
Will you do me a huge favor? Just move to
that side of the bed for me.


229
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:14,521
Oh, oh, oh sorry.


230
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,301
Just leave it. Just move to that side of the
bed.


231
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:18,061
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, no, no. Come on.


232
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:19,301
I got it.


233
00:08:19,621 --> 00:08:19,981
Okay.


234
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:20,621
I'm just gonna-


235
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:21,141
Can you


236
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:22,961
help me please? Can you, like, leave me?


237
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:23,221
Yeah.


238
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:24,841
Like, can I call my landlord?


239
00:08:25,301 --> 00:08:28,161
What? You guys both stay in here, right? Come
on, step on down.


240
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:28,181
Yes-


241
00:08:28,181 --> 00:08:29,181
Let's go. Come on.


242
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:29,501
... but we don't have a lease.


243
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:29,881
Okay.


244
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:31,761
Like, our landlord, our last lease-


245
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,201
But that doesn't matter right now, okay?


246
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:34,341
Because you guys are both staying here, so
there's-


247
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:34,661
So, I don't-


248
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,921
... occupant residency, okay?


249
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:37,921
I'm not trying to be rude. I'm very sorry.


250
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:38,381
I know. No.


251
00:08:38,381 --> 00:08:41,361
But I'm not understanding why I'm going to
jail when he didn't do-


252
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,801
You're going to jail for a separate incident.
It's not this incident.


253
00:08:43,801 --> 00:08:43,981
For what?


254
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,021
You're not going to jail for this.


255
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:46,761
For what am I going to jail for?


256
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,661
Uh, we're gonna explain that to you in a
minute, okay?


257
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:52,661
Is there any way they could de-cuff from the
front? Like, I promise I won't run. I'm too


258
00:08:52,661 --> 00:08:56,121
cold. We can't cuff it in the front. I got to
do the same thing every time for everybody-


259
00:08:56,141 --> 00:08:56,161
Okay


260
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,661
... but if you have a seat, medics will come
take a look at you.


261
00:08:58,661 --> 00:08:59,761
You know how long it's gonna be?


262
00:08:59,841 --> 00:08:59,861
Yeah.


263
00:08:59,861 --> 00:09:00,901
So I'd be in jail?


264
00:09:01,181 --> 00:09:05,201
No. I'll- I'm gonna explain it. We're gonna
fig- We got a bunch of things to figure out,


265
00:09:05,561 --> 00:09:09,041
okay? So we're gonna, we're gonna look at a
few things, okay, ma'am? So the medic's right


266
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:12,241
here. I'm gonna have you sit down and then
you can talk to him and tell him what's going


267
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:13,681
on, okay? This is like butt first or...


268
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:15,081
Just, yep, butt first.


269
00:09:17,781 --> 00:09:18,821
Yep, bring your leg up.


270
00:09:18,821 --> 00:09:20,761
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God. I can't, I can't,
I can't.


271
00:09:20,781 --> 00:09:21,181
Come on. I gotta help you.


272
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:24,221
Okay, hold on. Hold on. Oh, my God, my nail.
My nail, my nail.


273
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:28,741
Oh, oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, my pinky
nail.


274
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,261
Okay, okay.


275
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:31,221
There you go. You're fine.


276
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,881
Okay, okay, okay. [sighs]


277
00:09:33,881 --> 00:09:34,281
Okay.


278
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:38,741
So explain to this officer what's, what's
going on. You requested one, correct?


279
00:09:39,341 --> 00:09:43,801
Yeah. So pretty much I was trying to get away
from the situation and my


280
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,121
fiance-


281
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:45,461
Okay


282
00:09:45,461 --> 00:09:49,301
... took my daughter out of the stroller,
took her back in the house.


283
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:54,521
I was gone all night taking care of my
grandma because she has asthma and she was


284
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:59,461
having a very bad episode. And he literally,
all's he said was, "If you don't


285
00:09:59,481 --> 00:10:04,341
come home, I'm calling the cops. I got videos
of you doing this and you doing that." No, he


286
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:08,081
doesn't. There's only one camera and I
unhooked it and I took the wire with me.


287
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:08,461
Okay.


288
00:10:08,501 --> 00:10:13,141
But he said, "If you don't come home and talk
to me right now, then I'm calling the cops


289
00:10:13,161 --> 00:10:18,021
and talk to me right now, then I'm calling
the cops and you're going to jail, blah,


290
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:18,081
blah, blah, blah." He literally said, "If you
don't come home right now, blah, blah, blah-


291
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:22,781
Okay ... then I won't call the cops and then
we can just sit down and talk." He's acting


292
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,341
like a big child. Okay.


293
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:26,181
But he literally did this to my legs, like,
my back-


294
00:10:26,181 --> 00:10:28,141
What's, what's up with your neck? What,
what... did what to your legs?


295
00:10:28,141 --> 00:10:29,921
Do you want me to stand up and show you or-


296
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:32,041
Well, you can just show us right here. Just
start pointing, okay?


297
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:36,481
You can point on this shoulder right here,
it's very bruised. Um, all around my neck.


298
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,021
Like,


299
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:42,001
my back is very scratched up. Like, and he
did all of this.


300
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:46,601
The only thing I did to him was when he
pushed me into a corner, like, he


301
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:51,621
face-pushed me into a corner, the one in
there, as soon as you go in, um, where the


302
00:10:51,681 --> 00:10:56,641
crystal shelf is, he, like, grabbed my face
and pushed me into the corner and then I,


303
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,521
like, pushed him back from me and my hand
did, like-


304
00:10:59,521 --> 00:10:59,541
Okay


305
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:02,641
... push his throat and I said, "Get the f-
off of me."


306
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:02,901
Okay.


307
00:11:02,901 --> 00:11:05,261
So that is the only time I ever touched him.


308
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:05,501
Got it. Okay.


309
00:11:05,501 --> 00:11:10,441
But other than that, he literally just, like,
would not stop touching me, throwing me on


310
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:15,561
the bed. Like, "No, you [censored] . You're
not leaving." Like, "You're not driving off


311
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,661
in the car. That's our car. You're not doing
this."


312
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:18,101
Okay.


313
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:23,021
[sighs] He, like, literally just would not
let me leave and I was like, "I just need


314
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:24,981
time away from you. I need time to think.


315
00:11:24,981 --> 00:11:25,821
I don't want to be with you."


316
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,821
When did all this happen?


317
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:32,061
This happened, uh, last night was when it got
really bad, but the day before-


318
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:32,341
Okay


319
00:11:32,341 --> 00:11:34,821
... was when I had to go spend the night with
my grandma-


320
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:35,081
Okay


321
00:11:35,081 --> 00:11:35,921
... to do that.


322
00:11:36,081 --> 00:11:36,101
Okay.


323
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:39,601
And then he was like, "Really? You're gonna
spend all night with your grandma instead of


324
00:11:39,641 --> 00:11:44,521
sleeping in bed with me?" And his daughter
that is, like, 12 years


325
00:11:44,521 --> 00:11:44,701
old-


326
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:44,801
So really quick-


327
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:45,801
... 11


328
00:11:45,901 --> 00:11:46,481
... really quick, Destiny, okay? Hold on,
Destiny. Hold on.


329
00:11:46,501 --> 00:11:46,821
Uh-huh.


330
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:50,961
What do you need these gentlemen here to
check on you? You called them here. You


331
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:55,861
requested they come here. I just want, like,
my back, like, my legs, like, they just hurt


332
00:11:55,901 --> 00:12:00,501
so bad. Like, I can barely walk. Like, my, my
toe right there, my pinky, like, everything


333
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:04,141
hurts so bad. Like, I'm in physical therapy.
We're supposed to go today.


334
00:12:04,501 --> 00:12:09,241
We're supposed to go eight days in a row for,
like, a company truck hit


335
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:12,016
us.And we're supposed to get, like, this big
settlement.


336
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:17,135
And, um, they do the waterbed thing and the
massage thing and everything else.


337
00:12:17,475 --> 00:12:17,495
Okay.


338
00:12:17,495 --> 00:12:22,275
And, um, it's getting, like, a little bit
better, but, like, it hurts so [censored]


339
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,736
bad. And, like, my back is just, like-


340
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:25,155
She stated she took at least 16-


341
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:27,156
... killing me and, like, I just-


342
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:29,955
... Xanax. Her, her, her eyes are pretty pink
though, so that's why I was


343
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:30,855
... I don't understand why he, like, he keeps
barking at me.


344
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,295
Destiny, have you taken anything today?


345
00:12:32,615 --> 00:12:32,895
No.


346
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:33,955
You haven't taken nothing?


347
00:12:34,035 --> 00:12:34,656
No. No.


348
00:12:34,656 --> 00:12:36,495
No pills? Xanax?


349
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:36,515
No.


350
00:12:36,515 --> 00:12:37,335
You haven't been drinking?


351
00:12:37,755 --> 00:12:42,596
No. He keeps saying that, but no. He is
taking Xanaxes, he is drinking, he is taking


352
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:43,415
pain pills.


353
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:43,936
Okay.


354
00:12:43,955 --> 00:12:48,215
His mom gets pain pills and Xanaxes, the
peach footballs


355
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:52,856
and, uh, cocaine, and he goes over there
every day and snorts them with her.


356
00:12:53,135 --> 00:12:53,155
Okay.


357
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:56,415
Is there any way you'll look at my back and
see if it's really bad?


358
00:12:56,435 --> 00:12:57,415
Okay, please help her.


359
00:12:57,435 --> 00:12:58,255
Yeah, yeah, yeah.


360
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:00,475
Okay, just please be easy, easy, easy.


361
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:01,396
Here, step on out, okay?


362
00:13:01,475 --> 00:13:01,755
Okay.


363
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:02,236
I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna let you fall
far.


364
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:03,236
[knocking]


365
00:13:03,336 --> 00:13:05,375
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, my butt, my butt, oh,
God, oh, God, okay.


366
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:06,855
Well, I mean, they are hard plastic and a
little bit-


367
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:07,815
Hold on, sorry, a little wedgie.


368
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:09,555
Ow, ow, ow, okay.


369
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,275
Yep. Okay, go ahead turn in and face in,
okay?


370
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:11,395
Sure.


371
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,095
This, this gentleman here is gonna look at
ya.


372
00:13:13,295 --> 00:13:17,915
So, I don't understand why he's not going to
jail too if he's the one who beat my ass.


373
00:13:17,915 --> 00:13:22,115
So, you just got a little soft abrasion right
here. That's gonna heal on its own.


374
00:13:22,115 --> 00:13:23,375
You don't need to worry about that, okay?


375
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,235
You said that's fresh? Maybe.


376
00:13:24,235 --> 00:13:25,755
But can you look at his back?


377
00:13:25,755 --> 00:13:26,975
Maybe. Yeah.


378
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:31,715
Like his back is way less worse than mine.
Mine's way worse.


379
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,355
Okay.


380
00:13:33,155 --> 00:13:33,535
Okay.


381
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,555
Like, the whole thing is, is I was b-


382
00:13:37,035 --> 00:13:37,335
Okay.


383
00:13:37,595 --> 00:13:40,815
I was gone last night, and he got mad-


384
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:41,095
Okay. Yeah


385
00:13:41,095 --> 00:13:42,475
... that I wouldn't come home-


386
00:13:42,595 --> 00:13:42,615
Okay


387
00:13:42,615 --> 00:13:43,795
... and he called the cops.


388
00:13:43,795 --> 00:13:44,235
I understand.


389
00:13:44,235 --> 00:13:46,195
And he got his 11-year-old daughter-


390
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:46,215
Okay


391
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:47,675
... to lie for him and say that-


392
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:47,695
Okay


393
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:48,875
... I smacked him-


394
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:49,155
Okay


395
00:13:49,155 --> 00:13:51,875
... or scratched him, and she was sleeping.


396
00:13:51,935 --> 00:13:56,275
Okay. So, right now, you're gonna take a seat
back in. They can't do anything else for you


397
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:57,135
right now, you're gonna take a seat back in.
They can't do anything else for you right


398
00:13:57,155 --> 00:13:58,715
here, okay? Okay. Is there any way- We're all
gonna explain all this, okay?


399
00:13:58,955 --> 00:14:00,335
Okay. [police radio chatter]


400
00:14:00,515 --> 00:14:01,155
There you go.


401
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:01,855
Oh, God.


402
00:14:01,855 --> 00:14:03,495
Yep. Go ahead and move your feet in right
now.


403
00:14:03,495 --> 00:14:03,955
Is there any way-


404
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:04,355
Yep, move your feet in


405
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,275
... oh, I can pee before I go?


406
00:14:06,835 --> 00:14:07,975
No, you're gonna have to hold it.


407
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:08,495
I'm gonna pee-


408
00:14:08,675 --> 00:14:11,355
Okay? I'm, I'll make sure we get this
through, okay? We're gonna put this right


409
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:13,655
here. But can my baby please go with my,


410
00:14:14,255 --> 00:14:17,435
my family and not him? He's very abusive.


411
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:22,195
He smacks the baby and throws her in her bed,
and, like, he's very abusive.


412
00:14:22,475 --> 00:14:22,735
Okay.


413
00:14:22,735 --> 00:14:23,255
Like, he literally-


414
00:14:23,255 --> 00:14:24,875
Well, we're gonna, we're gonna double check,
okay?


415
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:24,955
He lit-


416
00:14:24,955 --> 00:14:26,755
We're gonna look at, like I said, we're gonna
look at a few things-


417
00:14:26,775 --> 00:14:26,795
He literally-


418
00:14:26,795 --> 00:14:27,755
... and then we'll see what we're doing.


419
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,555
... threw her across the room.


420
00:14:30,075 --> 00:14:30,835
Okay. Okay.


421
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:35,875
While officers were questioning her fiance
and getting evidence from her daughter, she


422
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:36,835
gave them a hard time.


423
00:14:36,975 --> 00:14:41,435
Excuse me. Excuse me. [knocking] I'm so


424
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:42,935
sorry, I'm just so hot.


425
00:14:42,935 --> 00:14:43,955
Ma'am, it's okay. Just listen for a second.


426
00:14:44,435 --> 00:14:44,575
It-


427
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:47,235
Is there, is there any way you could turn the
air up?


428
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:48,675
What? What?


429
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:50,195
Just hang tight with her.


430
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:50,695
Yes.


431
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:52,295
So,


432
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:57,975
okay. So, what, so are you guys both living
here together?


433
00:14:58,455 --> 00:14:59,695
Yeah, but I plan on moving.


434
00:15:00,155 --> 00:15:02,815
What happened this morning? Why, why did you
call us here?


435
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:07,175
Uh, because she came back home and she was
still


436
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:12,115
irate. She was still on Xanaxes and she told
me to call


437
00:15:12,115 --> 00:15:16,555
you. She said, she said she was gonna call
you guys because I beat her ass-


438
00:15:16,675 --> 00:15:16,995
Okay.


439
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:17,175
... with


440
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:20,895
So nothing physical happened between you guys
this morning? All that stuff happened last


441
00:15:20,935 --> 00:15:21,615
night? She just came back?


442
00:15:21,655 --> 00:15:22,315
No, this,


443
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:26,155
this happened this morning.


444
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,435
Okay. What's that from, buddy?


445
00:15:28,155 --> 00:15:31,015
Her, her pushing me away and me trying to
walk away.


446
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:31,915
Okay. Wha-


447
00:15:32,035 --> 00:15:32,055
And-


448
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,395
Okay. What's that from?


449
00:15:33,395 --> 00:15:34,755
And her punching me in my mouth.


450
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:35,375
This morning?


451
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:35,895
Yes.


452
00:15:36,015 --> 00:15:36,395
Okay.


453
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:40,335
And last night, uh, your other officer should
have documentation of it.


454
00:15:40,335 --> 00:15:42,115
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm gonna check that
too.


455
00:15:42,135 --> 00:15:43,115
They, they took pictures.


456
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:43,575
Okay. Perfect.


457
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:45,675
Because I tried to get her put in jail last
night.


458
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:47,015
Okay. [knocking]


459
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,115
God damn!


460
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:51,415
I can't hear you, ma'am. What?


461
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:54,175
I, this is hurting my shoulder, this
seatbelt.


462
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:58,015
Can you pull it down just a little bit this
way, please? And I'm really, really hot.


463
00:15:58,335 --> 00:15:59,435
I don't, I don't understand what you're
referring-


464
00:15:59,435 --> 00:16:02,815
Like, can you pull it, like, over, like, just
down, like, right there?


465
00:16:02,835 --> 00:16:02,935
And-


466
00:16:02,935 --> 00:16:03,035
Yeah


467
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,435
... can you please turn the air on?


468
00:16:04,435 --> 00:16:05,535
The, the air is on.


469
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:06,855
It's all the way up?


470
00:16:06,855 --> 00:16:09,995
Yeah, it's running. [door opening]


471
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:14,195
So, he's gonna have custody of my [censored]
baby?


472
00:16:14,715 --> 00:16:18,335
Um, was your daughter, uh, your older
daughter awake for everything that happened


473
00:16:18,335 --> 00:16:20,095
this morning? Yeah, yeah, that's why I would
like you to talk to her.


474
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,475
Would you mind going up and speaking with her
real quick for me?


475
00:16:22,675 --> 00:16:22,835
Yep.


476
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:23,995
Okay. [knocking]


477
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:29,155
[coughing]


478
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,215
[radio playing]


479
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:35,055
[laughing]


480
00:16:41,935 --> 00:16:46,655
Um, she put her, she put her hands on you and
there was, like, a big,


481
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:50,575
like, red mark on your back. And I was in
front of you.


482
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,975
I was, like, right there, and


483
00:16:54,075 --> 00:16:56,595
there was, like, a bunch of yelling and
stuff.


484
00:16:56,635 --> 00:16:58,375
Did she also throw the fan at me?


485
00:16:58,615 --> 00:16:59,115
Yeah.


486
00:16:59,535 --> 00:17:01,615
Did I put my hands on her whatsoever?


487
00:17:01,955 --> 00:17:05,935
Nope. And there was a shelf that she kicked
outside that she broke.


488
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:07,075
Thank you for talking to me, okay?


489
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:10,055
We're leaving today, baby. You don't have to
deal with this no more.


490
00:17:10,075 --> 00:17:11,215
Thank God.


491
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,815
Mom's probably gonna go to jail.


492
00:17:13,195 --> 00:17:13,655
Okay.


493
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:20,155
Why the [censored] does the abuser person get
to get my [censored]


494
00:17:20,395 --> 00:17:25,195
baby? [crying] This is [censored]


495
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,415
bullshit.


496
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:34,135
The person who beats the [censored] out of
me, I go to jail because


497
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:35,775
y'all wanna believe him


498
00:17:36,895 --> 00:17:40,395
because I wasn't here. Excuse me?


499
00:17:40,395 --> 00:17:44,435
[knocking]


500
00:17:45,855 --> 00:17:49,875
Can I at least get a tissue or something in
here and say bye to my baby?


501
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:52,155
Hold on. We have a lot of things we're
figuring out real quick.


502
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:52,915
Okay, but-


503
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:53,055
Okay?


504
00:17:53,055 --> 00:17:56,255
I'm like, I'm like drooling everywhere.


505
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,855
Okay. Hold on a minute, okay?


506
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:02,795
As officers arrested her, she broke down
crying, begging to see her baby and


507
00:18:02,875 --> 00:18:07,375
accusing her fiance of lying. Despite the
chaos, officers stayed calm,


508
00:18:07,455 --> 00:18:12,115
confirmed her warrants and let her kiss her
child goodbye before jail.


509
00:18:12,255 --> 00:18:14,035
Why? Because he's the one who beats me.


510
00:18:14,035 --> 00:18:14,695
Stay in there. Stay in there.


511
00:18:14,755 --> 00:18:16,515
No, don't tell him to kiss you.


512
00:18:16,615 --> 00:18:17,555
Put your leg in there. Put your leg in there.


513
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:18,715
You're hurting me!


514
00:18:18,755 --> 00:18:21,375
No, I'm not. [knocking]


515
00:18:29,645 --> 00:18:31,485
What are you doing? [hand slapping]


516
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:32,485
Stop.


517
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:36,265
You're gonna get charged with vandalism.
You're gonna get a felony.


518
00:18:37,986 --> 00:18:42,586
I want to see my baby. That's all I want.


519
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:46,365
I want to give her a kiss, she's crying.


520
00:18:46,586 --> 00:18:46,885
Can you not do-


521
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:46,946
Bout to call the mother in.


522
00:18:47,006 --> 00:18:50,766
Maybe, as you know, you won't because I'm
being a bitch.


523
00:18:50,766 --> 00:18:52,205
[hand slapping]


524
00:18:54,566 --> 00:18:58,885
I wanna say one thing to him and I wanna see
my baby before I go.


525
00:18:59,245 --> 00:18:59,285
No.


526
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,966
I will never be with you again.


527
00:19:02,566 --> 00:19:05,045
Fuck you! [hand slapping]


528
00:19:05,045 --> 00:19:06,745
Yeah, you must... They must not have been
tight.


529
00:19:08,785 --> 00:19:09,485
Hold on a minute.


530
00:19:10,606 --> 00:19:10,845
Hey-


531
00:19:10,845 --> 00:19:13,166
I'm not putting them back on until I see my
baby.


532
00:19:13,766 --> 00:19:15,086
So here's the deal. This is gonna... No.


533
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:15,106
Step-


534
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:17,245
I want my baby out.


535
00:19:18,505 --> 00:19:18,525
Turn around.


536
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,405
No, I want my baby.


537
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:21,005
Turn away from me.


538
00:19:21,086 --> 00:19:22,125
Turn around and face me.


539
00:19:22,305 --> 00:19:22,725
No.


540
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:24,845
Are you really gonna go this route?


541
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:28,425
I want to give my baby a kiss and then I will
cry, please.


542
00:19:28,985 --> 00:19:32,705
So that's not how this works, okay? You're
going to jail, for instance, that happens


543
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:35,006
five more times- I will never be with you
again.


544
00:19:35,045 --> 00:19:35,525
Stop.


545
00:19:36,045 --> 00:19:38,906
Never! Get out of my house!


546
00:19:39,165 --> 00:19:41,585
Stay right here. Stop. You wanna see your
child or not?


547
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:43,485
Ow, you're hurting me.


548
00:19:43,485 --> 00:19:44,806
I'm not. I am not hurting you.


549
00:19:44,806 --> 00:19:48,625
Yes, you are. You are hurting me. My
shoulder!


550
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:53,645
It hurts! You put it on to stay off of this


551
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:54,905
shoulder.


552
00:19:56,665 --> 00:20:01,005
Goddamn! Justin, don't ever fucking ask to be
with me again.


553
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:02,566
Go to your fucking mom.


554
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:03,726
Stop.


555
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:05,705
I just want... Ow!


556
00:20:07,365 --> 00:20:09,206
Can you untie these, please?


557
00:20:09,225 --> 00:20:09,546
No.


558
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:11,085
'Cause of the way you're acting? Why?


559
00:20:11,146 --> 00:20:14,546
I just wanna get my baby and fucking kiss.


560
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:19,665
He's gonna beat my ass when I go to jail
because I wasn't here last night


561
00:20:19,765 --> 00:20:21,145
and y'all believed him.


562
00:20:21,786 --> 00:20:24,005
Can you wipe this snot off my nose?


563
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:24,345
Yeah.


564
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:26,785
Come here, baby. I love you.


565
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:27,945
Oh.


566
00:20:29,905 --> 00:20:31,025
Here, I'll wipe it off.


567
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:36,205
You fucking happy I never wanna be with you?
You come here, give me a kiss.


568
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,025
I told, I told this cop if you start, I'm
gonna take her from you.


569
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:40,805
You don't have to be with me again. You did
this, not me.


570
00:20:40,805 --> 00:20:44,645
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Give mommy a
kiss. Take your binky.


571
00:20:44,925 --> 00:20:45,925
You have her scared.


572
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:49,405
Mwah. Yeah, because of you, I never wanna be
with you again.


573
00:20:49,425 --> 00:20:51,005
Do not be here when I get back.


574
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:52,305
I won't. Neither will my kids.


575
00:20:52,425 --> 00:20:55,265
Yeah, neither will fucking Joe. Joe will find
out.


576
00:20:55,465 --> 00:20:57,665
Okay, I'm getting emergency custody of my
daughter.


577
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,365
No, you're not. I will.


578
00:20:59,945 --> 00:21:00,365
No, you're not.


579
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,005
I'll be in jail for a day.


580
00:21:04,825 --> 00:21:05,205
Hey.


581
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:06,345
Yes?


582
00:21:06,445 --> 00:21:08,305
Okay. Your food stamp card.


583
00:21:09,145 --> 00:21:10,225
I want that with me.


584
00:21:10,305 --> 00:21:11,005
You want it with you?


585
00:21:11,065 --> 00:21:11,085
Yes.


586
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:11,945
You don't want it with him-


587
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:11,965
No


588
00:21:11,965 --> 00:21:13,225
... so that way he can feed your child?


589
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:13,865
No.


590
00:21:13,965 --> 00:21:14,285
Okay.


591
00:21:14,685 --> 00:21:15,985
He gets to sell it all.


592
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:16,345
Okay.


593
00:21:17,405 --> 00:21:17,985
She said no.


594
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:19,005
Okay, that's fine.


595
00:21:19,225 --> 00:21:21,965
Okay. So this is the deal. Yes, you're being
arrested today.


596
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:25,425
On not only whatever they called last night.


597
00:21:25,425 --> 00:21:30,145
I wasn't here so I can't attest to that, but
you did have a broadcast with us for your


598
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:33,225
events last night. But you also have two
warrants, which are both confirmed.


599
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,085
One out in Moraine, one out in Montgomery
County, so you're also going to jail on those


600
00:21:36,085 --> 00:21:36,405
two. Are you s-


601
00:21:36,785 --> 00:21:40,125
Your daughter is gonna stay with dad here,
where you guys have been living.


602
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:43,385
When you get out, if you decide you guys are
gonna separate-


603
00:21:43,425 --> 00:21:44,745
We're moving in two days.


604
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:45,065
Okay.


605
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:45,505
Two days.


606
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:50,225
Well, if you guys are moving in two days,
that's fine, you can take daughter, but you


607
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:53,225
can't be living together if you guys are
gonna act like this 'cause it's-


608
00:21:53,225 --> 00:21:53,465
No, I don't want-


609
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:57,225
Look, it's, it's gonna get... It's pretty
soon it's gonna get child ser- children's


610
00:21:57,225 --> 00:21:58,805
services involved. No, we've already had CPS.


611
00:21:58,905 --> 00:21:59,845
Okay, so you've already-


612
00:21:59,845 --> 00:21:59,985
My daughter is 15 months and she has a hand-


613
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,505
You've already had it, so you understand?


614
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:02,125
... with a hand.


615
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:03,805
Okay, so you understand?


616
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:08,525
So I'm not gonna do warrants. I'm sorry, I
don't mean to be difficult but I'm having a


617
00:22:08,525 --> 00:22:10,725
panic attack really, really bad.


618
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:11,605
What's up?


619
00:22:12,145 --> 00:22:15,785
I'm having a panic attack really, really bad.


620
00:22:15,785 --> 00:22:17,285
[laughs] I can't breathe. [coughing]


621
00:22:17,285 --> 00:22:17,425
Hey.


622
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:17,685
I should have an inhaler. [gasping]


623
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:17,885
Where's your inhaler at?


624
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:18,345
It's in my safe. My bruise on my left


625
00:22:36,165 --> 00:22:39,325
shoulder is hurting me so bad.


626
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:43,285
Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.


627
00:22:43,365 --> 00:22:46,365
The woman ended up getting arrested for
domestic violence.


628
00:22:46,505 --> 00:22:50,265
If she's found guilty, what kind of
punishment do you think would be fair?


629
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:54,085
Whatever you said, double it for this next
suspect on our list.


630
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:57,405
This case didn't just break the rules, it
went way beyond them.


631
00:22:57,465 --> 00:23:00,565
Even the officers were shocked by what they
found.


632
00:23:00,845 --> 00:23:01,645
Where's my son?


633
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:03,245
He's in the front seat of that car.


634
00:23:03,905 --> 00:23:04,365
How?


635
00:23:04,585 --> 00:23:05,565
He fell out your car.


636
00:23:05,565 --> 00:23:05,585
That car?


637
00:23:05,745 --> 00:23:06,785
I was sleeping.


638
00:23:06,825 --> 00:23:06,845
Did the-


639
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:07,845
I was sleeping.


640
00:23:07,945 --> 00:23:08,945
Where was your son at?


641
00:23:09,045 --> 00:23:09,345
I was sleeping. He was on this side.


642
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,245
Who was driving?


643
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:15,145
On September 15th, 2021, a shocking call came
in that someone


644
00:23:15,265 --> 00:23:19,985
saw a child fall out of a moving car during a
U-turn, but the car didn't


645
00:23:20,005 --> 00:23:23,225
stop, it just kept going. You'll never guess
what happened next.


646
00:23:23,425 --> 00:23:24,185
Where's my son?


647
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:25,765
He's in the front seat of that car.


648
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:26,905
How?


649
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:28,105
He fell out your car.


650
00:23:28,605 --> 00:23:28,625
That car?


651
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:30,325
How he fell out my car?


652
00:23:30,425 --> 00:23:31,965
Just walk, I don't wanna put your handcuffs
on. It's for your kids.


653
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:34,165
Just walk with us to the back of this car
like we're walking and talking.


654
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:36,825
When we clear the rear of your car, we're
gonna put you back in.


655
00:23:36,965 --> 00:23:37,625
T- 10-60, 10-4


656
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:42,685
A man who saw everything explains to the
officer what happened and how a


657
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:47,385
small child tumbled out. The little
four-year-old was terrified by what


658
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:47,885
happened.


659
00:23:50,205 --> 00:23:52,745
How you doing?


660
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:54,885
Hey, sir. Thanks for coming so quick.


661
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:55,205
What happened? What happened?


662
00:23:55,205 --> 00:23:59,125
I've never seen anything like that. This
silver car, best I can tell it's silver.


663
00:23:59,145 --> 00:23:59,165
Yeah.


664
00:23:59,345 --> 00:24:03,785
Pulls around and I see the damn doors open
and this kid comes rolling out of it.


665
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:04,825
He falls out of the car?


666
00:24:04,825 --> 00:24:07,605
He just came falling out of it, slide, rolls
all the way over.


667
00:24:07,605 --> 00:24:08,385
And the car took off?


668
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:09,605
The car just kept rolling.


669
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:10,205
Which way did it go?


670
00:24:10,405 --> 00:24:10,485
It kept going.


671
00:24:10,485 --> 00:24:12,005
Silver SUV, pickup?


672
00:24:12,045 --> 00:24:14,985
No, a, just a Caravan, a car. Just a car.


673
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:16,585
It's a car or what kind? Like yours?


674
00:24:16,685 --> 00:24:20,245
Car. Yeah, uh, no, like a car-car. Like a
regular, [laughs] you know, sedan.


675
00:24:20,345 --> 00:24:21,685
Alpha 216, Flagler.


676
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:25,185
Go ahead.


677
00:24:26,305 --> 00:24:31,165
All right, I'm out with the caller. He
advised, "I have Bravo Mike juvenile, three


678
00:24:31,305 --> 00:24:35,145
years old, who fell out of a silver unknown
make or model vehicle that continued-"


679
00:24:35,705 --> 00:24:36,625
100 westbound


680
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:40,995
... westbound on 100." That's all I have.Did
it hit a y'all car or did...?


681
00:24:41,015 --> 00:24:42,175
No, nothing like that.


682
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:42,435
My God.


683
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:42,915
10-4.


684
00:24:45,555 --> 00:24:47,055
Mind if make call to my work?


685
00:24:47,095 --> 00:24:49,135
Yeah, please do. [car hooting]


686
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,995
Older model, newer model, anything except the
stickers on it?


687
00:24:54,475 --> 00:24:57,015
Older model. It didn't look new by no means.


688
00:24:57,135 --> 00:24:57,916
Like I said, my truck-


689
00:24:58,395 --> 00:25:02,215
Alpha 216, he's finding older model. He
didn't get a good look at the vehicle.


690
00:25:03,275 --> 00:25:04,495
I meant it wasn't a new car.


691
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:04,815
Okay.


692
00:25:04,815 --> 00:25:05,575
It wasn't a new car.


693
00:25:05,975 --> 00:25:06,676
Is that for us to go and see?


694
00:25:06,676 --> 00:25:08,296
The problem is I was just... I saw him-


695
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:08,436
Oh


696
00:25:08,436 --> 00:25:10,416
... and I was in disbelief and I just got
over there.


697
00:25:10,435 --> 00:25:11,535
I'm in disbelief right now. [laughs] .


698
00:25:11,535 --> 00:25:11,816
Yeah. Um...


699
00:25:11,816 --> 00:25:13,335
Hey, boy, are you all right, pal?


700
00:25:13,456 --> 00:25:13,695
All


701
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:14,575
right.


702
00:25:14,815 --> 00:25:17,755
He's got, he's got a little cut. Let me see,
buddy. Thank you.


703
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:18,335
Oh my gosh.


704
00:25:18,335 --> 00:25:19,616
He's got a little cut on his finger.


705
00:25:19,835 --> 00:25:21,356
Hey, do you know your name, big guy?


706
00:25:21,655 --> 00:25:22,356
Come right here.


707
00:25:22,916 --> 00:25:22,936
What?


708
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:23,855
Can you tell us your name, buddy?


709
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:24,696
Do you know your name, bud?


710
00:25:26,715 --> 00:25:28,095
You can tell us, what's your name?


711
00:25:28,095 --> 00:25:31,655
[beep] .


712
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,995
Hmm. Okay.


713
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:35,215
He's had a hard time telling me about
anything-


714
00:25:35,215 --> 00:25:35,555
Yeah.


715
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:35,875
Um,


716
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,195
sorry, let me get more clear.


717
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:40,695
So the, so the ca- He came out of the front
seat or back seat?


718
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:42,315
Back seat, back right. Back right.


719
00:25:42,315 --> 00:25:44,195
So the, the car came off Old Kings Road,
right?


720
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,715
He, he or she made a U-turn.


721
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:47,235
Made a U-turn?


722
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:47,915
Right where that white car is-


723
00:25:47,935 --> 00:25:48,135
Okay


724
00:25:48,135 --> 00:25:50,435
... right there. I'm sitting first one in
line over there.


725
00:25:50,475 --> 00:25:50,755
Yeah.


726
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:51,475
Off 213, 10-4.


727
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:54,355
They turned and I thought it was a dent in
the door, but it was-


728
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:54,595
Albany, where are you going?


729
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:55,555
... the damn door open.


730
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,435
And he fell in the back?


731
00:25:56,435 --> 00:25:56,915
And he just watched


732
00:25:56,935 --> 00:26:01,175
Just signal 14, subject says he may have an
049 Massachusetts.


733
00:26:01,195 --> 00:26:01,235
He goes boom, boom, boom, over here in the
curb.


734
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:02,235
Yeah.


735
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,475
And I just, I just looked at him.


736
00:26:03,715 --> 00:26:03,775
And that's all you have?


737
00:26:03,775 --> 00:26:06,975
Like I say, I just, silver car is all I can
think of.


738
00:26:07,095 --> 00:26:07,375
Yeah.


739
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:08,635
And I just got... I kind of ran that-


740
00:26:08,635 --> 00:26:10,875
Did the door close when it kept going or did
it just...


741
00:26:10,895 --> 00:26:12,475
Not th- No, it was, it was still open. Um-


742
00:26:12,475 --> 00:26:14,875
High rate... Was it reckless? High rate of
speed or just...


743
00:26:14,895 --> 00:26:16,635
It wasn't like it was out of control.


744
00:26:16,715 --> 00:26:17,055
Yeah, yeah.


745
00:26:17,055 --> 00:26:19,235
It wasn't like it was burning tires or
anything.


746
00:26:19,235 --> 00:26:19,575
Yeah.


747
00:26:19,955 --> 00:26:20,275
Um,


748
00:26:21,155 --> 00:26:22,655
I don't know. I even tried to ask him-


749
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:22,775
Holy Molly


750
00:26:22,775 --> 00:26:24,855
... like did anybody know that you were out
of the car?


751
00:26:24,855 --> 00:26:26,415
[laughs] . That's why I'm wondering they
don't know he fell out.


752
00:26:26,455 --> 00:26:28,195
Yeah. Were you riding with your mom?


753
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,135
Were you riding with your mommy?


754
00:26:31,555 --> 00:26:32,795
Was daddy with you too?


755
00:26:33,775 --> 00:26:34,415
Just mom?


756
00:26:35,275 --> 00:26:35,595
Okay.


757
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:35,915
Okay.


758
00:26:36,035 --> 00:26:37,435
Do you have your ID on you, sir?


759
00:26:37,435 --> 00:26:37,595
I, uh, yes.


760
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,495
Just for our report.


761
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:39,055
Yeah, no problem.


762
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:39,735
We're not gonna get them.


763
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:44,615
Did you see how his mother came back only
after realizing too late that she had left


764
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,095
her four-year-old behind?


765
00:26:46,175 --> 00:26:46,915
Where's my son?


766
00:26:47,015 --> 00:26:48,495
He's in the front seat of that car.


767
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:50,295
He fell out your car.


768
00:26:50,795 --> 00:26:50,815
10-4.


769
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:52,535
How he fell out my car?


770
00:26:52,995 --> 00:26:54,815
Copy tag for the parents who just showed up.


771
00:26:54,815 --> 00:26:55,015
Matt-


772
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,275
How did he fall out my car?


773
00:26:56,275 --> 00:26:57,055
You tell, you tell me that.


774
00:26:57,055 --> 00:26:57,075
10-4.


775
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:57,895
Was he buckled in?


776
00:26:57,915 --> 00:26:58,495
I was sleeping.


777
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,375
Where was your son at?


778
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:01,055
I was sleeping. He was on this side.


779
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,495
Who was driving? [laughs]


780
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:04,635
My brother. He said he he-


781
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:08,375
he said he heard the door open, but he
didn't, he didn't think like-


782
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,815
10-4. Showing that there's no vehicle
registration to it. Registration is showing


783
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:13,955
canceled. Everybody have their IDs out, their
IDs ready?


784
00:27:14,735 --> 00:27:17,035
He's in the front seat of the car. If you
wanna go get him from this gentleman.


785
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:18,275
Oh, my god. What happened?


786
00:27:18,315 --> 00:27:20,175
Do you want to come get him out of this man's
car?


787
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:21,075
Is he okay?


788
00:27:21,075 --> 00:27:23,275
He's o- He's got a little cut on his finger.
He's okay.


789
00:27:27,455 --> 00:27:29,155
When did y'all realize he wasn't in the car?


790
00:27:29,935 --> 00:27:34,815
Right now. Like right now. We got onto the
expressway and my daughter was like, "Well,


791
00:27:34,815 --> 00:27:35,515
Bobby what did... Why you leave?"


792
00:27:35,855 --> 00:27:37,395
It's not... Just don't, don't yell at him.


793
00:27:37,435 --> 00:27:37,715
He's-


794
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:38,395
I know, I'm... It's not-


795
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,255
You wanna... You wanna pick him up? He's
scared.


796
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:41,515
And


797
00:27:42,135 --> 00:27:43,375
his hand hurts. Okay?


798
00:27:44,015 --> 00:27:45,315
Let me just, uh... [laughs]


799
00:27:45,875 --> 00:27:47,415
We had, we had a crash going down on 30.


800
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:47,715
So,


801
00:27:48,595 --> 00:27:53,395
this gentleman says the silver car makes the
U-turn, as they U-turn, back door opens up,


802
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:55,135
he falls out. Car continues


803
00:27:55,915 --> 00:27:56,655
westbound.


804
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:57,635
The doors are locked. I don't know how.


805
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,855
She said she gets on the interstate and
realized their kid in the backseat.


806
00:27:59,855 --> 00:28:02,355
She was sleeping, the brother was driving.
They returned to the scene.


807
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:05,895
Um, he's got a small cut on his finger. All
right. Well, appreciate it, man. You wanna...


808
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:08,255
I'll get you outta here so you won't have to
get run over. But that's all right?


809
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:08,555
Yeah.


810
00:28:08,715 --> 00:28:12,335
Hey guys, I'm gonna get him outta here. Just
wanna... I'll close your door. Are you


811
00:28:12,395 --> 00:28:14,775
getting all his stuff? All right. I'll get
you out with the ambulance here.


812
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,855
Oh, goodness. Where's everybody's car seats?


813
00:28:19,895 --> 00:28:21,295
They gonna wear a seatbelt, right?


814
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:24,175
Um, well, you have... There's gonna be four
kids in that-


815
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:24,515
Nine, seven-


816
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:26,675
... only three seats.


817
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:27,915
So how-


818
00:28:27,915 --> 00:28:28,515
How many seat-


819
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:29,975
How many seats? Four kids for three seats.


820
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:31,255
With three seat belts.


821
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:32,015
They all fit there.


822
00:28:32,455 --> 00:28:34,475
It doesn't matter if they all fit there. How
many seat belts are there?


823
00:28:34,995 --> 00:28:35,135
Oh.


824
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:38,195
There's three seat belts. Every juvenile
needs to be in a seat belt.


825
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,595
So obviously someone's not in a seat belt if
there's four kids.


826
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,475
I mean, I just got this car.


827
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:45,775
I used to have a big van, but I-


828
00:28:45,815 --> 00:28:50,715
So you're saying if I, if I just get this car
and I wanna sit four kids in the backseat,


829
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:51,835
I'm gonna make sure there's four seat belts?


830
00:28:52,595 --> 00:28:53,135
10-4.


831
00:28:53,335 --> 00:28:54,655
So did you check to see the seat belt for the
car?


832
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,115
I have six kids, what do you want?


833
00:28:56,115 --> 00:28:57,795
I, I know, but I understand that.


834
00:28:57,875 --> 00:28:58,755
I'll take 121 victors in the Z section.


835
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,835
This what I was saying. This is my dream.


836
00:29:00,895 --> 00:29:01,015
I understand, but-


837
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:03,915
I didn't think that my son would ever do
something like that.


838
00:29:04,015 --> 00:29:05,135
10-4. Do you have your, your ID?


839
00:29:05,875 --> 00:29:05,895
No.


840
00:29:05,935 --> 00:29:06,555
You don't have anything?


841
00:29:07,595 --> 00:29:08,355
Can I get your name?


842
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:09,795
He got my name.


843
00:29:10,095 --> 00:29:10,715
He got your name?


844
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:11,195
Yeah.


845
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:12,895
All right. Have y'all been smoking?


846
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,635
Yeah, I've been smoking one joint.


847
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:15,175
When?


848
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:16,735
Like, a couple...


849
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:18,935
Like, couple, like 20 minutes ago.


850
00:29:19,155 --> 00:29:22,135
20 minutes ago? And you're driving? Four kids
in the backseat?


851
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:23,755
I, I had window down.


852
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:26,135
You had your window down? Were you smoking in
the car?


853
00:29:26,675 --> 00:29:27,535
Yeah, one time.


854
00:29:27,635 --> 00:29:29,735
You were smoking in the car with them in the
back?


855
00:29:30,015 --> 00:29:30,955
I had the window down though.


856
00:29:32,115 --> 00:29:33,395
Do you have any more weed in the car?


857
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:34,175
No, no, no weed.


858
00:29:34,275 --> 00:29:36,875
Can you step out for me so we can talk over
here?


859
00:29:37,055 --> 00:29:38,235
No, but under state law,


860
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:41,415
every child needs to be in a seat belt at
least.


861
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:42,175
I know that.


862
00:29:42,175 --> 00:29:44,435
At certain ages. So, how are they all in seat
belts?


863
00:29:44,435 --> 00:29:46,595
I buckled them in a seat belt. Is the child
locked great?


864
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:50,475
I, I can't tell which way it's gonna, gotta
go. I also have a key in there.


865
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:52,675
I don't know which way it goes.


866
00:29:53,835 --> 00:29:54,275
210.


867
00:29:54,535 --> 00:29:59,015
They didn't even have the child locked in and
was smoking with kids in the car.


868
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:01,795
Can we really call them responsible parents?


869
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:06,355
Due first. Case number generated for their
area.


870
00:30:06,355 --> 00:30:08,535
Can you do me a favor, sweetie? Can you try
to open this door when I close it?


871
00:30:08,535 --> 00:30:10,415
[door closing] Go ahead and try to open it.


872
00:30:12,775 --> 00:30:13,595
They're on now.


873
00:30:14,215 --> 00:30:14,655
10-4.


874
00:30:15,055 --> 00:30:16,655
They're on now. They weren't on before.


875
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:20,775
Step in the car. Yeah, come over here.


876
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:23,775
Where are you guys coming from? [alarm
beaming]


877
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,815
I'm coming from Florida.


878
00:30:26,495 --> 00:30:29,155
Well, wait. Where in Florida? Where you head-
Where are you coming from in Florida?


879
00:30:29,155 --> 00:30:30,475
Trying to get to South Carolina.


880
00:30:30,695 --> 00:30:32,895
Okay. What part of Florida are you guys
coming from?


881
00:30:32,895 --> 00:30:33,935
Gotta explain to the guy.


882
00:30:34,315 --> 00:30:35,095
Very far away.


883
00:30:35,115 --> 00:30:35,415
Okay.


884
00:30:35,515 --> 00:30:35,935
Far,


885
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,175
far away.


886
00:30:38,375 --> 00:30:39,235
Trying to get to South Carolina.


887
00:30:39,235 --> 00:30:39,975
Just type them by name.


888
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,055
Possibly out of order for a


889
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,315
10-27 10-29 10-6.


890
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:45,555
This guy.


891
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:46,275
Okay.


892
00:30:47,333 --> 00:30:47,854
10-4.


893
00:30:48,393 --> 00:30:49,493
Can he sit back in the car?


894
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:50,813
He can sit back in the car. [car door bangs]


895
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,573
So, you say you were smoking in the car with
them in there?


896
00:30:52,813 --> 00:30:53,193
Yeah.


897
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,573
Is there any more weed in the car at all?


898
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:56,074
Like, probably a joint, yeah.


899
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:56,794
A joint?


900
00:30:57,393 --> 00:30:58,353
Where would that joint be at?


901
00:30:58,773 --> 00:30:59,753
It's, like, in the car and


902
00:30:59,753 --> 00:31:01,913
... was it, is it in the Swisher's wrapper in
the


903
00:31:02,573 --> 00:31:02,933
car?


904
00:31:03,234 --> 00:31:04,113
No. It's actually in the back.


905
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:05,573
In the back? [car horn honks] All right.


906
00:31:05,574 --> 00:31:06,834
Do you have medical marijuana card?


907
00:31:07,334 --> 00:31:07,654
Oh, no.


908
00:31:08,173 --> 00:31:09,413
You don't have medical marijuana card?


909
00:31:10,113 --> 00:31:15,093
So my question is, is how do you not realize
that the door opens and one of the kids fly


910
00:31:15,093 --> 00:31:16,094
out and then we get on 95?


911
00:31:16,094 --> 00:31:19,073
'Cause I ain't, I ain't hear anything.


912
00:31:19,073 --> 00:31:19,673
[car revs]


913
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,473
You didn't hear the door open and shut?


914
00:31:22,393 --> 00:31:24,414
I kind of did hear something that why I was
like-


915
00:31:24,473 --> 00:31:26,153
And see a kid fall out of the car?


916
00:31:27,473 --> 00:31:29,014
I kinda did hear something.


917
00:31:29,434 --> 00:31:33,113
So you know, as the driver, you're
responsible to make sure that everyone has a


918
00:31:33,793 --> 00:31:37,534
seatbelt on, right? So if there's four kids
in the back of that car and three seat belts,


919
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:42,174
how does everyone have a seatbelt on? They
didn't have seat belts on, did they? None of


920
00:31:42,273 --> 00:31:43,253
them had seat belts on. I thought that they
did.


921
00:31:44,093 --> 00:31:44,233
So


922
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:49,713
my question is, is if there's three seat
belts and there's four kids, how do you get


923
00:31:49,733 --> 00:31:50,793
three seat belts and there's four kids, how
do you get three seat belts on four kids?


924
00:31:51,893 --> 00:31:56,213
It, it's impossible 'cause there's no way to
put three seat belts on four kids.


925
00:31:56,433 --> 00:32:00,413
That means one kid didn't have a seat belt on
and obviously the kid that didn't have a seat


926
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:01,433
belt on and obviously the kid that didn't
have a seat belt on is the one that flew out


927
00:32:03,113 --> 00:32:04,133
the kid that didn't have a seat belt on is
the one that flew out the car and into the


928
00:32:04,193 --> 00:32:06,253
road, right? I was just driving for my
sister. She was tired.


929
00:32:06,273 --> 00:32:09,333
All right. At this time, you're detained. All
right, we'll talk to you in a little bit,


930
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:11,873
okay? Okay. Hey, Dessie?


931
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:14,493
Dessie?


932
00:32:15,613 --> 00:32:19,573
Dessie? [car horn honks]


933
00:32:20,353 --> 00:32:22,073
You're under arrest.


934
00:32:22,073 --> 00:32:24,113
No... You're just detained right now, okay?
You're not under arrest at this time.


935
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:28,153
You can come out here as they come on, but
for now, you are detained because this is


936
00:32:28,793 --> 00:32:29,913
what happened, okay? Oh, he's just being
detained?


937
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:33,113
Yeah. Separate to that, strong odor of
marijuana coming out of this car.


938
00:32:34,073 --> 00:32:34,853
Marijuana?


939
00:32:35,093 --> 00:32:38,873
Yeah. There's a strong odor of marijuana
coming out of this car, so that's why he's


940
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:41,973
detained. Go ahead to finish answering his
questions and we'll, uh, tell you what's


941
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:42,553
going on. Oh, I mean-


942
00:32:42,773 --> 00:32:45,713
Finish answering his questions and get him
out of here. So few things going on.


943
00:32:46,013 --> 00:32:49,633
One, how old were the kids in the back seat?
W- what age range are they from?


944
00:32:51,093 --> 00:32:52,273
My daughter is nine-


945
00:32:52,293 --> 00:32:52,533
Okay


946
00:32:52,533 --> 00:32:53,853
... three. My other daughter is


947
00:32:54,773 --> 00:32:55,253
seven.


948
00:32:55,333 --> 00:32:55,653
Okay.


949
00:32:56,053 --> 00:32:56,673
My son is, um-


950
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:57,893
Fire an alpha 3211. Check


951
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,133
... five, and Jube's four.


952
00:32:59,133 --> 00:33:00,813
All right, so the four-year-old should be in
a car seat.


953
00:33:01,173 --> 00:33:05,133
According to Florida law, all children age
five and younger must be restrained in a


954
00:33:05,153 --> 00:33:06,853
federally approved crash... in a child
restraint device.


955
00:33:07,293 --> 00:33:11,053
We're going to have to make this... This is a
booster seat, car seat, or any other


956
00:33:11,113 --> 00:33:14,253
manufactured integrated child seat. So two of
them aren't in car seats. Okay?


957
00:33:14,873 --> 00:33:15,433
Second thing,


958
00:33:16,393 --> 00:33:19,973
four kids in the back seat, only three seat
belts available for them. That's a problem.


959
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:24,433
And the third thing is we all can smell the
marijuana coming out of the car, including


960
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:25,553
the third thing is we all can smell the
marijuana coming out of the car, including
the third thing is we all can smell the marij


961
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:27,193
uana coming out of the car, including the
third thing is we all can smell the marij
uana coming out of the car, including the thi


962
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:28,033
rd thing is we all can smell the marij uana
coming out of the car, including the third


963
00:33:28,033 --> 00:33:31,053
thing is we all can smell the marij uana
coming out of the car, including the third
thing is we all can smell the marij uana comi


964
00:33:31,073 --> 00:33:31,273
ng out of the car, including the third thing
is we all can smell the marij uana coming out


965
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,193
of the car, including the third thing is we
all can smell the marij uana coming out of


966
00:33:33,193 --> 00:33:36,673
the car, including the third thing is we all
can smell the marij uana coming out of the


967
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:37,193
car, including the third thing is we all can
smell the marij uana coming out of the car,


968
00:33:37,413 --> 00:33:38,013
including the third thing is we all can smell
the marij uana coming out of the car,
including the third thing is we all can smell


969
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:42,993
the marij uana coming out of the car,
including the thi rd thing is we all can


970
00:33:43,013 --> 00:33:44,873
smell the marij uana coming out of the car,
including the Paramedics and the


971
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:46,333
firefighters. How is this related to fire
fighters? So we'll look into those three


972
00:33:46,353 --> 00:33:49,593
things right now. How are you doing, sir? So
hang tight while we finish doing what we're


973
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:51,813
doing. How many of you went to a 911 on Lake
15th? That's my 30 year wedding anniversary.


974
00:33:52,453 --> 00:33:55,493
Is there any marijuana in this car, do you
know? All right. Well- You can check it. ...


975
00:33:55,593 --> 00:33:57,933
w- well, we e- with or without your
permission, just the smell of marijuana alone


976
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,813
give us the right to check your car. So
that's what deputy- Wait. Where, where, where


977
00:34:00,813 --> 00:34:02,873
are we? I don't even know- You're in Palm
Coast, Florida, probably about half hour


978
00:34:02,973 --> 00:34:03,693
north of Daytona. All right. Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to talk to you for a little bit now,


979
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:03,753
okay? You mind coming over here with me so we
can talk? Just to the front of his car. And


980
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:04,493
the front of his car. And the pills I found
in the glove box, the Xanax bars? The Xanax?


981
00:34:04,493 --> 00:34:07,513
Yeah, those are my anxiety pills. Okay. Are
those pre- I know, I know- Do you have a


982
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,873
prescription? I don't have it in my, um,
bottle. No, I don't have my prescription. Do


983
00:34:10,193 --> 00:34:10,633
you have a prescription for Xanax in
particular? Um,


984
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,033
they give me, um,


985
00:34:14,633 --> 00:34:16,873
some type of pills like th- that's for like
that.


986
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:19,933
Has, has that doctor prescribed Xanax for us
too? That's what we're asking.


987
00:34:20,033 --> 00:34:20,413
Um-


988
00:34:20,413 --> 00:34:22,873
'Cause we, we can check that. We can go onto
the record we can check to see.


989
00:34:22,873 --> 00:34:23,633
No, not yet. No.


990
00:34:23,633 --> 00:34:25,113
So he hasn't prescribed you any Xanax before?


991
00:34:25,113 --> 00:34:28,293
But they, they prescribed me with pills that
are like in the Xanax family type.


992
00:34:28,293 --> 00:34:29,133
In the Xanax family?


993
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:29,153
Yeah.


994
00:34:29,153 --> 00:34:31,493
But he hasn't prescribed you those, those
pills?


995
00:34:31,773 --> 00:34:31,873
No.


996
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:32,573
Where'd you get those pills?


997
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:35,393
Because I have bad anxiety pills. I mean,
anxiety problems.


998
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,473
What, where did you get those pills from?


999
00:34:37,833 --> 00:34:39,153
My friend gave 'em to me.


1000
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,413
Your friend gave you those pills?


1001
00:34:40,513 --> 00:34:40,773
Yeah.


1002
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:41,173
Okay.


1003
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:42,873
I take it for my anxieties that I had.


1004
00:34:43,093 --> 00:34:44,873
Does your friend have a prescription for the
pills?


1005
00:34:44,893 --> 00:34:45,653
My, my sister.


1006
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:46,853
Is it his, is it his prescription?


1007
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,653
Probably, probably he has a prescription of
them. I don't know.


1008
00:34:49,653 --> 00:34:50,413
Probably. Okay.


1009
00:34:50,413 --> 00:34:52,913
'Cause my sister passed away and, um,


1010
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:58,313
not too long ago, so I, I'm dealing with like
anxieties and stuff.


1011
00:34:58,353 --> 00:34:59,273
So I would have to take-


1012
00:34:59,353 --> 00:35:02,153
That's what I'm saying though, if, if you got
anxiety, that's when you go to the doctor and


1013
00:35:02,213 --> 00:35:03,673
the doctor and the doctor prescribe you the
medication and stuff.


1014
00:35:03,853 --> 00:35:03,873
Yeah.


1015
00:35:03,873 --> 00:35:04,413
But getting it from-


1016
00:35:04,413 --> 00:35:08,073
If you see the bottles right there, you can
probably see the old ones that I have right


1017
00:35:08,553 --> 00:35:09,373
there. So, the, the secondary con-


1018
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,733
I've been trying to go to the doctor.


1019
00:35:10,733 --> 00:35:14,713
The, the secondary concern that I have is,
when you guys left Miami- Okay ...


1020
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,593
okay, you got four, four children in the back
seat.


1021
00:35:16,893 --> 00:35:17,173
Um-


1022
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:18,193
I have six kids


1023
00:35:18,193 --> 00:35:18,493
They're,


1024
00:35:19,113 --> 00:35:23,313
they're ages on the back seat right now, is
it five, or nine, five, four and three?


1025
00:35:24,253 --> 00:35:25,613
That's, that's our ages in the back seat?


1026
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:26,573
Uh-huh.


1027
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:26,733
Uh.


1028
00:35:26,733 --> 00:35:27,653
Um, yeah, nine.


1029
00:35:28,513 --> 00:35:29,013
Five.


1030
00:35:29,873 --> 00:35:30,293
Seven.


1031
00:35:30,393 --> 00:35:31,433
Seven. Nine, seven?


1032
00:35:31,653 --> 00:35:32,433
Five and four.


1033
00:35:32,493 --> 00:35:35,353
Five and four. Okay. So under Florida law,


1034
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:36,293
uh,


1035
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:38,993
and y- do you have driver's license in
Florida?


1036
00:35:39,713 --> 00:35:40,973
No, I have to get one. They just started
giving them to people.


1037
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,673
So you don't have a driver's license from
Florida? Okay.


1038
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:44,653
Well, it's, it's [car horn honks]


1039
00:35:45,693 --> 00:35:50,573
law that states that any juvenile that's in a
vehicle that's under the age of five needs to


1040
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:55,273
be in a car seat. On top of that, any
juvenile that's under the age of 18 needs to


1041
00:35:55,313 --> 00:36:00,093
have a seatbelt on. All right, so the, the
problem is, is these cars are designed for,


1042
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:04,613
for three passengers in the rear seat. Right
now, we have four passengers in the rear


1043
00:36:05,033 --> 00:36:05,053
seat. Right now, we have four passengers in
the rear seat. Okay? Oh, my God.


1044
00:36:05,053 --> 00:36:05,333
So,


1045
00:36:06,013 --> 00:36:09,233
it, it, the car is legally not allowed to
travel with four juveniles.


1046
00:36:09,453 --> 00:36:12,853
Even four adults in the back seat, you
couldn't travel with four adults in the back


1047
00:36:13,153 --> 00:36:17,933
seat if you want to. Because everyone has to
have the option to be able to sit with a seat


1048
00:36:17,933 --> 00:36:20,193
belt, even as an adult, you don't have to sit
with a seatbelt in the back seat, you still


1049
00:36:20,193 --> 00:36:24,713
have to sit with a seatbelt in the back seat,
you still have to have that option. [car


1050
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:28,533
revs] But like I said, the main concern is,
is that we left Miami, we put four juveniles


1051
00:36:29,493 --> 00:36:31,333
in the back seat, and obviously one of the
juveniles didn't have a seatbelt on. Because


1052
00:36:32,113 --> 00:36:33,013
you got three seat belts- We had two. Yeah,
I'm, I'm still saying, I'm still saying-


1053
00:36:33,013 --> 00:36:33,733
Three seat belts-


1054
00:36:34,113 --> 00:36:34,613
I'm still saying-


1055
00:36:34,713 --> 00:36:38,953
And four juveniles, that leaves someone out
from getting it. And obviously, the one


1056
00:36:39,273 --> 00:36:42,773
that... I don't, I don't know why the door
opened, I don't know if he had hit the door


1057
00:36:42,773 --> 00:36:44,953
or if it was a malfunction of the door. I see
that there's damage on that side of the car.


1058
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:45,293
Yeah, there's a mess on this side.


1059
00:36:45,293 --> 00:36:48,453
So with, with the damage on the side of the
car, maybe the door lock's not working


1060
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,733
properly. I, I, I don't know that, and I'm
not a mechanic.


1061
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:51,953
But all I know is that-


1062
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:54,471
By simple math,


1063
00:36:55,131 --> 00:36:59,711
three seat belts, four juveniles, and one
juvenile falls out, that's most likely the


1064
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:00,791
one juvenile falls out, that's most likely
the one that wasn't wearing the seat belt.


1065
00:37:01,491 --> 00:37:01,931
Okay?


1066
00:37:02,571 --> 00:37:04,091
So that's, that's the concern that I have.


1067
00:37:04,091 --> 00:37:07,191
The secondary concern is, um, who was the
male that was driving the car?


1068
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:08,352
My little brother.


1069
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:13,331
That's your little brother? Okay. Um, were
you awake when your brother was smoking


1070
00:37:13,431 --> 00:37:13,672
marijuana in the car? No.


1071
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:15,291
No, you weren't awake when he was-


1072
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,172
I was sleeping. That's why-


1073
00:37:16,172 --> 00:37:19,771
Okay, you were sleeping when he was smoking
marijuana? Did you know that he had marijuana


1074
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:22,932
on him? Uh, no. I wasn't aware that he had
marijuana on him.


1075
00:37:22,972 --> 00:37:24,671
Okay, so you weren't aware that he had
marijuana?


1076
00:37:24,711 --> 00:37:25,691
How much, how much marijuana he had?


1077
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:31,051
Uh, it doesn't matter if it's, if it's an
ounce or 10 ounces, it's still not legal to


1078
00:37:31,351 --> 00:37:36,152
have marijuana with you. And then obviously
it's not... If, if he smoked it 20 minutes


1079
00:37:36,251 --> 00:37:36,572
ago, it's, it's not legal to-


1080
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:40,671
I don't know. I don't know when he smoked it.
I don't know if he smoked it when he stopped


1081
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:41,432
here. I don't know. I was sleeping.


1082
00:37:41,711 --> 00:37:46,051
Get's back on the road, and now he's driving
under the influence of a narcotic [horn


1083
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:51,451
honks] with four juveniles. One of 'em
obviously not in a seat. I can't, I can't say


1084
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:54,371
that they all weren't in seat belts. I know
that when we came up to the car, they weren't


1085
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:58,031
in seat belts. I know that when we came up to
the car, they weren't in their seat belts.


1086
00:37:59,071 --> 00:38:02,551
But, um, two of 'em were supposed to be in
car seats. Which ones? Like you said, I


1087
00:38:02,551 --> 00:38:05,091
thought you said the four-year-old was
supposed to be in the car seat. So anybody


1088
00:38:05,651 --> 00:38:06,831
under the age of five needs to be in a car
seat. Under eight?


1089
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:09,131
Five and under. Five and under has to be in a
car seat.


1090
00:38:09,151 --> 00:38:12,831
So two out of the four kids should've been
in- Car seats ... federally approved car


1091
00:38:12,951 --> 00:38:17,831
seats. The officer grows more concerned. He
points out that not only was the driver


1092
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:20,131
unlicensed, but the kids weren't wearing seat
belts.


1093
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:24,131
There were no child safety seats, and there
may have been drugs in the car.


1094
00:38:24,291 --> 00:38:29,131
Trying to avoid making a scene in front of
the kids, the officers calmly ask her to


1095
00:38:29,151 --> 00:38:32,511
walk to the back of the car, where they
quietly detain her.


1096
00:38:32,831 --> 00:38:33,371
Your brother,


1097
00:38:34,191 --> 00:38:36,731
do you mind running him up to South Carolina
to go meet his dad?


1098
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,791
Or bring his dad back so that he can see his
kid?


1099
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,731
All that. That would be stuff that


1100
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:48,291
I would expect a parent to do, um, for their
children to make sure that their children are


1101
00:38:48,771 --> 00:38:52,731
safe. Okay? Um, do you have any family that's
in the area here? Where is your family at?


1102
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:55,931
Far away. We don't live here at all.


1103
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:58,131
I, I understand you don't live here, but
where would your family be at?


1104
00:38:58,131 --> 00:38:59,591
Where would the nearest relative be at?


1105
00:38:59,591 --> 00:39:02,471
Very far. Miami, Florida. And nobody have a
car.


1106
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,191
And nobody has a car down in Miami? They
don't know anybody that could-


1107
00:39:05,731 --> 00:39:06,131
No.


1108
00:39:06,451 --> 00:39:06,851
Okay.


1109
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:11,611
I just got my car. And this car is not even
under my name.


1110
00:39:12,271 --> 00:39:16,751
I h- I was gonna do all the registration and
everything, um, on the... Today, the 15th?


1111
00:39:16,931 --> 00:39:17,171
Yeah.


1112
00:39:17,551 --> 00:39:21,111
Today. Whenever I get back to Miami with my
brother. My brother's the one with the


1113
00:39:22,531 --> 00:39:23,351
license. My older brother.


1114
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,111
Your older brother's the one with the
license?


1115
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:26,391
And-


1116
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,711
But he had to go to work.


1117
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:28,851
Your older brother had to go to work?


1118
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:29,111
He stayed.


1119
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:31,811
Okay. So your younger brother, does he have a
license?


1120
00:39:32,011 --> 00:39:33,451
He never had a license before.


1121
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:35,171
So your younger brother never had a license
before?


1122
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:36,131
He's not been suspended or anything like
that.


1123
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,451
Okay, so did you know he didn't have a
license?


1124
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:39,731
Um,


1125
00:39:40,671 --> 00:39:44,871
I think I... Yeah, I thought... Yeah, he
didn't... I don't think... Yeah, he didn't


1126
00:39:44,951 --> 00:39:49,511
have a license. No. Okay. So that, that's the
other concern that I have, is now you're


1127
00:39:50,191 --> 00:39:50,591
asking your little brother to drive you
knowing that-


1128
00:39:50,591 --> 00:39:50,871
I never-


1129
00:39:50,871 --> 00:39:52,231
Knowing that he doesn't have a license-


1130
00:39:52,231 --> 00:39:52,251
Right


1131
00:39:52,251 --> 00:39:56,411
... and you're putting your children on the
back of the car who don't have seat belts on


1132
00:39:56,411 --> 00:39:56,691
a non-licensed driver.


1133
00:39:56,691 --> 00:39:59,391
Listen, I love all of my kids. I understand
what you're saying.


1134
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:01,511
I'm not... This isn't a question of if you
love your kids or not. Okay?


1135
00:40:01,511 --> 00:40:02,151
I know I...


1136
00:40:02,151 --> 00:40:02,311
This-


1137
00:40:02,451 --> 00:40:06,451
What happened was a mistake. I understand. I
don't know what you want me to do.


1138
00:40:08,771 --> 00:40:12,691
There's, there's a lot [laughs] I want you to
do as a mom to, to, for the safety of your,


1139
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:17,331
for the safety of your, for your children.
Okay, I can go buy a car seat. I can, I can


1140
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,431
go buy a car seat. I can, I can go buy a car
seat. But at that right now, I don't care.


1141
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:20,651
Okay. At this time, we're gonna detain you.
All right?


1142
00:40:20,651 --> 00:40:21,231
Over here?


1143
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:26,171
Yes. No, do this, Edward. Do this. Walk with

1152
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:43,711
I'll explain it all in a second. I'm gonna
explain it in a second.


1153
00:40:43,731 --> 00:40:46,851
Keep walking with us like we're talking, and

Do you know you have a 12-year-old possibly

00:40:54,271 --> 00:40:55,211
I'm gonna tell you, I'm gonna tell you why.


1160

All right. At this point we're detaining you.
Go ahead and put your hands behind your back.


1162
00:41:00,711 --> 00:41:02,571
But I was sleeping, man.


1163
00:41:02,571 --> 00:41:03,011
20 minutes, 21 minutes.


1164
00:41:03,011 --> 00:41:03,791
Why you gotta do this?


1165
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:06,911
'Cause there's many things going on here.
Many things, not just one.


1166
00:41:07,051 --> 00:41:09,691
Many things that put these kids' lives on
danger today. Not just one thing.


1167
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:13,791
Between too many kids in the, without seat
belts, without the s- without the car seat.


1168
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:17,851
No one realized that a kid fell out. The
drugs in the car. There's a lotta things


1169
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:19,171
going on right now. Okay? Okay.


1170
00:41:19,191 --> 00:41:20,691
It's not just one thing.


1171
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:21,951
I understand what you're saying though, sir.


1172
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:22,071
Yeah.


1173
00:41:22,071 --> 00:41:22,951
I understand.


1174
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:24,851
But


1175
00:41:25,871 --> 00:41:27,531
I just got this car.


1176
00:41:29,431 --> 00:41:30,571
Alpha 216 11.


1177
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:33,191
Where's my baby G?


1178
00:41:33,271 --> 00:41:33,951
Alpha 216.


1179
00:41:34,011 --> 00:41:35,011
Don't do this to me.


1180
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:36,611
Hispanic unit within.


1181
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:40,971
726.


1182
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:46,171
Or any time during questioning, you can if
foreign attorney won't be appointed to


1183
00:41:46,551 --> 00:41:50,351
represent you. If at any time you wish to
stop talking or have any attorney present,


1184
00:41:50,351 --> 00:41:51,651
all questioning will stop at your request. Do
you understand these rights?


1185
00:41:52,271 --> 00:41:53,691
With these rights in mind, are you willing to
talk to me?


1186
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:54,831
I will.


1187
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:55,911
I'm sorry?


1188
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:56,791
Make sense? Yeah.


1189
00:41:57,051 --> 00:41:58,811
I said with these rights in mind, are you
willing to talk to me?


1190
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:01,191
I don't know what to say.


1191
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:02,151
No? You don't wanna talk to us?


1192
00:42:02,891 --> 00:42:03,811
I would be honest.


1193
00:42:04,791 --> 00:42:07,771
Like I said, we're giving you the opportunity
to talk to us. We already know most the


1194
00:42:07,771 --> 00:42:09,811
answers. We just wanna talk to you to try to
figure out more stuff.


1195
00:42:10,571 --> 00:42:11,191
I don't really-


1196
00:42:11,191 --> 00:42:12,731
[beep]


1197
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:13,811
... know what to talk about really.


1198
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:18,951
Like i- it... You... First, you have to say
yes you wanna talk to us, or no you don't


1199
00:42:19,251 --> 00:42:19,371
wanna talk to us, or no you don't wanna talk
to us. No, I don't wanna talk to you.


1200
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:20,851
No, you don't wanna talk to us? Okay.


1201
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,231
But that mean, that mean I'm going to jail?


1202
00:42:23,491 --> 00:42:23,771
What?


1203
00:42:23,771 --> 00:42:24,451
I'm going to jail?


1204
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:29,711
Um, right now we're at it's still an
investigation, so we're still doing an


1205
00:42:30,531 --> 00:42:33,271
investigation into it. Okay? All right? If
you were to go to jail today, your charges


1206
00:42:34,091 --> 00:42:38,531
would be driving with no driver's license.
Okay? Um, I don't know how many suspensions


1207
00:42:39,251 --> 00:42:39,371
you've had. Um,


1208
00:42:40,911 --> 00:42:45,511
possibly driving under the influence,
narcotics, and also child neglect for having


1209
00:42:45,551 --> 00:42:46,511
narcotics in the vehicle


1210
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:52,191
with the children on there. And then also
failure to for due cause to make sure that


1211
00:42:52,271 --> 00:42:56,151
those children... Since you're the driver,
you're responsible to make sure that they're


1212
00:42:56,171 --> 00:42:59,111
in car seats and they're in seat belts. And
you basically drove off and let one fall out


1213
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:02,253
of the car. So you, so you'd be, you'd be
charged with child neglect.


1214
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,033
So I'm going to jail?


1215
00:43:04,513 --> 00:43:07,613
Like I said, we're still doing the
investigation. That's why we wanted to talk


1216
00:43:08,613 --> 00:43:10,814
to talk to you. So at this time, d- would you
want to talk to us, yes or no?


1217
00:43:12,193 --> 00:43:12,253
No.


1218
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:14,234
No, you don't want to talk to us? Okay. All
right.


1219
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:20,493
The mom and her brother are arrested for
child neglect and drugs.


1220
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:25,293
DCF is called, but the mum asks them to
contact her mother, to which the


1221
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,453
officer agrees.


1222
00:43:26,474 --> 00:43:31,433
At this point, your brother's being placed on
arrest for driving under, um, driving with a


1223
00:43:31,453 --> 00:43:35,914
suspended driver's license, felony,
possession of marijuana, and the child


1224
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:40,533
neglect. You're also being placed under
arrest for child neglect and possession of


1225
00:43:40,533 --> 00:43:41,753
that Xanax pills, if they turn out to be
Xanax, okay?


1226
00:43:42,813 --> 00:43:44,254
The two of you had every


1227
00:43:45,433 --> 00:43:50,013
reason or right to either, one, put those
kids in a car seat or make sure they were


1228
00:43:50,013 --> 00:43:51,053
properly buckled in, but the two of you
failed.


1229
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:56,394
I mean, you put your children's life in
danger by letting him smoke marijuana and


1230
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:56,833
driving like that.


1231
00:43:57,573 --> 00:43:57,593
I did not.


1232
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,053
Okay, well-


1233
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:00,253
All right, let me call somebody so they can
come get my kid.


1234
00:44:00,253 --> 00:44:04,333
All right, give me, here's the... Right now,
I can't sit with your kids while I still have


1235
00:44:04,373 --> 00:44:06,933
to come through Miami. So I did call the
Department of Children and Families.


1236
00:44:06,973 --> 00:44:11,533
They are on their way to take possession of
your kids, but if you give me that name, I


1237
00:44:11,613 --> 00:44:15,633
will give that name to them, and that would
be someone they could contact to turn the


1238
00:44:15,773 --> 00:44:16,653
kids over, because I can't... Miami's what?
How far is Miami from here?


1239
00:44:16,653 --> 00:44:17,193
About four hours by now.


1240
00:44:17,193 --> 00:44:20,313
Four hour, four or five hours? I can't send
them to McDonald's parking lot with the kids


1241
00:44:20,313 --> 00:44:23,973
for four hours, so- Then how am I going to
get out to go get my kids? I have to call


1242
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:28,053
somebody to come get them. All right. So who
do you want me to give this number to, to DCF


1243
00:44:28,293 --> 00:44:28,833
for your kids to come get them? My mom.


1244
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:28,853
10-4.


1245
00:44:28,853 --> 00:44:30,573
You've got my mom number, right? We do?


1246
00:44:30,773 --> 00:44:30,933
Yeah.


1247
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:31,553
Do we... Okay.


1248
00:44:31,633 --> 00:44:31,753
We do.


1249
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:31,853
Well, can you call her?


1250
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:36,693
Um, before he leaves, he'll give that to me,
and I'll give it to the D- DCF investigator,


1251
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:40,553
and I'll give it to the D- DCF investigator,
and they will call her, okay? What I'm gonna


1252
00:44:40,873 --> 00:44:45,633
do is we're going to take you, we're gonna
place you in the back of that patrol car. I'm


1253
00:44:45,653 --> 00:44:49,413
gonna place you in the back of that patrol
car. I'm gonna take your oldest child, put


1254
00:44:49,713 --> 00:44:50,513
him in one of these cars, and I'm gonna drive
the car, literally from here to the parking


1255
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:50,973
lot, and get them off the roadway. Um, did
the kids eat this morning? 61-53? Breakfast


1256
00:44:52,393 --> 00:44:54,033
or anything? Ma'am, did the kids eat
breakfast or anything?


1257
00:44:54,033 --> 00:44:54,593
East 11th North today.


1258
00:44:54,593 --> 00:44:55,033
Kids eat.


1259
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:58,753
All right. If I was going to McDonald's to
get them something to eat, does anybody have


1260
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:02,253
any allergies or anything, that they can't
eat? All right, so I'll go to McDonald's and


1261
00:45:02,253 --> 00:45:02,733
get them some food. 10-4.


1262
00:45:02,953 --> 00:45:05,913
Any investigators should be here in the next
half hour, 45 minutes, okay?


1263
00:45:06,313 --> 00:45:08,693
So we step on out, [bell ringing] and they're
gonna walk you over to the other car.


1264
00:45:10,513 --> 00:45:12,173
And then, there's a puppy in the car too,
correct?


1265
00:45:12,173 --> 00:45:13,273
Yeah, those are my puppy.


1266
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:15,833
All right. Puppies? There's more than one in
there?


1267
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:16,053
There's four of them.


1268
00:45:16,053 --> 00:45:19,853
All right. They're gonna go to, we're gonna
turn them over to... [car door closing] I


1269
00:45:19,853 --> 00:45:21,853
can't... To our, um, animal control.


1270
00:45:21,913 --> 00:45:22,933
Hey, can I pick them up?


1271
00:45:22,933 --> 00:45:24,773
Yeah, I'll give him your name. He'll be able
to come pick them up.


1272
00:45:25,493 --> 00:45:29,553
Um, can I get my, like 10-4, can I take my
credit card in here, so I can grab my own


1273
00:45:29,653 --> 00:45:32,533
cell phone? Yes, we'll grab your credit card.
You want your credit card and your cell phone


1274
00:45:33,093 --> 00:45:33,393
out of the car, correct? Yes.


1275
00:45:33,453 --> 00:45:35,273
Okay, we'll grab that out of the car for you
before we go.


1276
00:45:35,513 --> 00:45:38,673
So I give every- I give you, brother, the
opportunity, do you have anything on your


1277
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:42,293
persons? Because if you have anything on your
persons, I can go get a female deputy to come


1278
00:45:42,473 --> 00:45:46,093
and search you. All right? But an induction
of anything into my inmate facility is going


1279
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,553
to be a secondary charge. So this is why I
give you a few-


1280
00:45:47,593 --> 00:45:50,313
So how am I gonna get my car if it's not
under my name on here?


1281
00:45:50,313 --> 00:45:52,713
Well, here's... That- that's the problem. The
car is gonna get towed.


1282
00:45:52,893 --> 00:45:52,913
10-4.


1283
00:45:52,913 --> 00:45:57,413
It's gonna go to the local tow pound. You
won't be able to get it out until you bring a


1284
00:45:57,413 --> 00:46:00,673
valid registration and insurance for the car.
Because if the car is not registered, and the


1285
00:46:00,673 --> 00:46:01,853
car is not registered, and the car is not
insured, so you shouldn't be driving this on


1286
00:46:02,813 --> 00:46:03,033
the car is not insured, so you shouldn't be
driving this on the roads. Okay?


1287
00:46:03,033 --> 00:46:04,073
Okay. All right, it's all right.


1288
00:46:04,193 --> 00:46:04,493
So that-


1289
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:05,833
I see everything you guys are doing. It's all
right.


1290
00:46:05,853 --> 00:46:06,133
Yeah.


1291
00:46:08,053 --> 00:46:11,753
Not everything that we're doing. It's
everything that you, the choices that we've


1292
00:46:11,913 --> 00:46:12,213
selected to do today. Okay?


1293
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:13,233
Oh, true.


1294
00:46:13,473 --> 00:46:18,073
The mother was charged with neglecting her
child and possessing illegal substances,


1295
00:46:18,073 --> 00:46:22,753
[keyboard clicking] and was sentenced to two
years of community control followed by


1296
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:25,853
probation, along with a six-month driver's
license suspension.


1297
00:46:25,913 --> 00:46:30,693
Her brother was charged with child neglect
and failure to register the vehicle,


1298
00:46:30,813 --> 00:46:32,493
though the latter charges were dropped.


1299
00:46:32,593 --> 00:46:37,573
He was sentenced to three years of probation,
180 days in jail, a


1300
00:46:37,573 --> 00:46:42,073
drug evaluation, and no contact with the
victims during his supervision.


1301
00:46:42,173 --> 00:46:47,113
In the next case, the children didn't fall
out of the car, but what happened was just as


1302
00:46:47,213 --> 00:46:48,273
dangerous. It was on, it was on, it was on.


1303
00:46:48,273 --> 00:46:49,573
There's no key in it. You fucking serious?


1304
00:46:49,573 --> 00:46:52,133
I y- I can pull my key, I can pull my key
out, bro.


1305
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:52,293
Jesus.


1306
00:46:52,413 --> 00:46:57,233
On a hot summer day, June 21st, 2024, police
got a call


1307
00:46:57,233 --> 00:47:00,293
about a parked car at a Harbor Freight store.


1308
00:47:00,453 --> 00:47:04,033
Inside that car were children screaming and
crying.


1309
00:47:04,313 --> 00:47:07,873
What is wrong? How dare you leave a child in
here without the air on? Are you seriously?


1310
00:47:07,873 --> 00:47:08,773
I literally... It was on.


1311
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:09,173
You're fucking crying, dude.


1312
00:47:09,173 --> 00:47:09,693
What do you mean?


1313
00:47:09,853 --> 00:47:13,613
When officers got to the parking lot, they
found a terrifying scene.


1314
00:47:13,733 --> 00:47:17,553
Two young kids locked inside a parked car
with no air conditioning.


1315
00:47:17,673 --> 00:47:22,633
The outside temperature was 92 degrees, and
the children were crying in distress.


1316
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:23,993
Thank you very much. Yep.


1317
00:47:23,993 --> 00:47:31,873
[car alarm going off]


1318
00:47:34,153 --> 00:47:35,873
Hi, sweetie, are you able to unlock the door?


1319
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,993
Are you hot? [car alarm going off]


1320
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:45,453
I literally just walked in. Open this fucking
door right now. What is wrong?


1321
00:47:45,873 --> 00:47:47,933
How dare you leave a child in here without
the air on? Are you seriously?


1322
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:49,213
I literally... It was on.


1323
00:47:49,213 --> 00:47:49,593
You're fucking crying, dude.


1324
00:47:49,593 --> 00:47:50,973
What do you mean? It- it was on.


1325
00:47:50,973 --> 00:47:51,873
It's not on, dude.


1326
00:47:51,873 --> 00:47:51,893
I did-


1327
00:47:51,893 --> 00:47:52,773
There's no key in there.


1328
00:47:52,873 --> 00:47:53,653
Dude, I promise you-


1329
00:47:53,773 --> 00:47:53,873
Are you serious?


1330
00:47:53,873 --> 00:47:55,893
... I promise you it was on. It was on, it
was on, it was on.


1331
00:47:55,893 --> 00:47:56,793
There's no key in it.


1332
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:58,173
I- I- I can pull my key-


1333
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:58,393
Are you fucking serious?


1334
00:47:58,393 --> 00:47:59,733
I can pull my key out, bro.


1335
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:00,573
Jesus Christ.


1336
00:48:00,713 --> 00:48:03,773
Dude, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Dude,
please don't take my kids. I'm so sorry.


1337
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:04,813
What is wrong with you?


1338
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:08,013
Turn the car. Get some AC in here.


1339
00:48:08,013 --> 00:48:09,213
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, please.


1340
00:48:09,433 --> 00:48:10,133
Are you guys okay?


1341
00:48:10,593 --> 00:48:12,593
I'm so sorry, guys. [children crying]


1342
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:13,293
Are you guys okay?


1343
00:48:14,013 --> 00:48:18,353
Dude, I've literally been in there for like
five minutes. Please don't take my kids.


1344
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:18,373
Dude.


1345
00:48:18,373 --> 00:48:19,233
I'm so sorry.


1346
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:21,333
That is ridiculous, dude. Where's your ID at?


1347
00:48:23,493 --> 00:48:23,893
Fine.


1348
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:25,693
You're lucky I didn't smash your window out,
dude.


1349
00:48:29,953 --> 00:48:31,593
35 medic to 41, one second.


1350
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:32,153
Oh, my goodness.


1351
00:48:32,153 --> 00:48:32,813
Where's your ID at?


1352
00:48:32,853 --> 00:48:35,173
I don't know. Can I please just talk to you?


1353
00:48:35,293 --> 00:48:37,253
Okay, I'm gonna have the medics look at these
kids. Can you step over here?


1354
00:48:37,253 --> 00:48:39,233
Okay, that's fine. Can I please talk to you?


1355
00:48:40,193 --> 00:48:44,153
There's two, two of them in there, super hot.
They were crying when I pulled up.


1356
00:48:45,453 --> 00:48:46,293
Can I please talk to you?


1357
00:48:46,313 --> 00:48:46,653
About what?


1358
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:51,553
16-54. Look, I- I've been doing this a lot,
man. I- I tried to return something.


1359
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:54,253
I... They're- they're having an issue
returning it.


1360
00:48:54,253 --> 00:48:56,573
I didn't realize that it was gonna take
years, so please


1361
00:48:56,653 --> 00:48:57,853
16-54.


1362
00:49:04,355 --> 00:49:05,235
Can I give them a hug?


1363
00:49:05,675 --> 00:49:06,935
Just stay back for a second, dude.


1364
00:49:07,415 --> 00:49:08,635
Can you come with me?


1365
00:49:10,995 --> 00:49:11,875
How long have they been in here?


1366
00:49:11,875 --> 00:49:12,236
Like, he won't believe you went


1367
00:49:12,895 --> 00:49:13,216
10.


1368
00:49:13,256 --> 00:49:13,856
I know, I just-


1369
00:49:13,856 --> 00:49:14,756
Oh, it's pretty hot, dude.


1370
00:49:14,756 --> 00:49:16,775
Yeah, I, I know. I, I ran in-


1371
00:49:16,775 --> 00:49:16,955
It's 10.


1372
00:49:16,955 --> 00:49:17,835
I tried to return something-


1373
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:17,936
It's 10.


1374
00:49:17,936 --> 00:49:19,415
I tried to come back out. I-


1375
00:49:19,575 --> 00:49:19,775
Gardner.


1376
00:49:19,775 --> 00:49:22,435
... came and leave my key on and I thought
that I had left it on.


1377
00:49:22,436 --> 00:49:24,915
The car was off when I got here. Come over
here.


1378
00:49:25,235 --> 00:49:26,376
So far, it's 58 A-


1379
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:27,075
Sit right here


1380
00:49:27,075 --> 00:49:30,135
... 49 Rene Avenue, 8649 Rene Avenue.


1381
00:49:30,315 --> 00:49:34,595
Caller's dad curves in a white red blue
short. He was turning 50 or so.


1382
00:49:35,455 --> 00:49:35,936
Oh, how old?


1383
00:49:36,235 --> 00:49:39,035
He does have depression and cancer. Recent
diag-


1384
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:40,095
So, what's goin' on, man?


1385
00:49:40,436 --> 00:49:41,875
Currently in his room.


1386
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:43,575
I'm struggling, okay.


1387
00:49:43,936 --> 00:49:44,456
And he's throwing up 10 times an hour.


1388
00:49:44,475 --> 00:49:44,495
Okay.


1389
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,855
I ran inside to return somethin'. They were
asleep, I didn't wanna wake them up.


1390
00:49:47,855 --> 00:49:47,875
Mm-hmm.


1391
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:50,616
They have no clue. Been busy all fucking day.


1392
00:49:50,715 --> 00:49:50,895
Okay.


1393
00:49:51,096 --> 00:49:52,835
I can leave my key on.


1394
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:53,195
Yeah.


1395
00:49:53,195 --> 00:49:55,116
And leave the key re- or leave the car
running.


1396
00:49:55,135 --> 00:49:55,155
Yeah.


1397
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:57,975
And I had thought I had did that and
apparently I had flicked it back.


1398
00:49:58,415 --> 00:50:00,815
They had ran inside, I'd been in there for
five, 10 minutes-


1399
00:50:01,255 --> 00:50:01,275
Yeah


1400
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:05,415
... and they're, they were having an issue
returning the item that I had t- or that I


1401
00:50:05,596 --> 00:50:09,435
was trying to return. So I was coming back
out here and then I see somebody walking


1402
00:50:09,435 --> 00:50:10,535
around my car. I'm like, "What the fuck?"


1403
00:50:11,036 --> 00:50:11,355
Yeah.


1404
00:50:12,395 --> 00:50:15,635
Like, dude, I promise. It was an honest
mistake. I'm, I'm fucking going through...


1405
00:50:15,635 --> 00:50:16,995
I've been doing this shit alone.


1406
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:18,035
Mm-hmm.


1407
00:50:18,035 --> 00:50:21,495
A- and they were in there fighting. I, I
fucked up and I realize that, bro.


1408
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:22,115
Yeah?


1409
00:50:22,715 --> 00:50:24,715
Real quick, do you have any warrants or
anything like that?


1410
00:50:24,815 --> 00:50:24,956
No.


1411
00:50:25,455 --> 00:50:26,815
Huh? You have nothin'?


1412
00:50:26,875 --> 00:50:27,195
No.


1413
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:32,035
So my under- so my understanding is this, is
that these medics were saying it was


1414
00:50:33,856 --> 00:50:36,775
extremely hot in that car. I know, and I've,
I've fucked up man and I'm fucked up.


1415
00:50:36,775 --> 00:50:37,215
Please don't-


1416
00:50:37,215 --> 00:50:37,376
Yeah?


1417
00:50:37,376 --> 00:50:40,656
... take my kids from me. I'm fucked up and I
will never do it again. I promise.


1418
00:50:40,656 --> 00:50:42,135
Well, first of all, you need to relax.


1419
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:45,415
I understand it's a stressful situation and
everything, but buddy...


1420
00:50:46,755 --> 00:50:48,475
I know I fucked up, man.


1421
00:50:48,496 --> 00:50:48,875
Yeah.


1422
00:50:50,795 --> 00:50:50,995
So-


1423
00:50:51,095 --> 00:50:52,095
I'm so sorry.


1424
00:50:52,095 --> 00:50:54,895
So, so r- real quick, look at me.
Realistically, how long were you in there?


1425
00:50:55,215 --> 00:50:56,516
Five, 10 minutes, man.


1426
00:50:57,195 --> 00:50:58,235
Five, 10 minutes, I promise. Five, 10
minutes.


1427
00:50:58,235 --> 00:51:02,756
And also, do you... Okay, five to 10 minutes
in this type of heat with nothing running,


1428
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:03,696
with the-


1429
00:51:03,795 --> 00:51:04,535
It wasn't off.


1430
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,915
With the windows up in the car.


1431
00:51:06,695 --> 00:51:08,516
You understand how hot that gets inside of a
vehicle?


1432
00:51:08,555 --> 00:51:09,156
Yes, sir.


1433
00:51:09,415 --> 00:51:12,035
Do you understand that it can kill a child
within three or four minutes?


1434
00:51:12,675 --> 00:51:14,715
I didn't realize it could get that fast.


1435
00:51:14,735 --> 00:51:15,076
Huh?


1436
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:16,335
I didn't realize it was that-


1437
00:51:16,395 --> 00:51:17,895
Heat, heatstroke's the real thing, boss.


1438
00:51:17,895 --> 00:51:18,276
Where?


1439
00:51:18,676 --> 00:51:19,596
No, not right now. No.


1440
00:51:19,596 --> 00:51:20,975
She's, she's reaching for me.


1441
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:21,515
Not right now.


1442
00:51:22,975 --> 00:51:24,695
Not right now. We're, we're talking to you.


1443
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:29,315
We understand it's stressful, we understand
everything else that's going on. All right?


1444
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:32,335
Where you working?


1445
00:51:32,696 --> 00:51:37,256
I'm not right now. I'm doing this shit al- I
don't have help, man. I'm doing this shit


1446
00:51:37,336 --> 00:51:37,996
alone. Where you living?


1447
00:51:38,275 --> 00:51:38,435
I


1448
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:40,996
stay with a friend that's letting me stay
with her.


1449
00:51:40,996 --> 00:51:43,936
Well, okay, right now they're gonna check
your kids, make sure your kids are okay.


1450
00:51:44,156 --> 00:51:44,535
Okay.


1451
00:51:44,615 --> 00:51:45,075
All right?


1452
00:51:47,275 --> 00:51:50,016
This is what I'm gon-... You're just gonna
sit right there, buddy, 'cause I'm not gonna


1453
00:51:50,016 --> 00:51:52,055
put you in the back of a car. I'm not doing
that right now.


1454
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:55,315
All right? 'Cause you're talking to me, I'm
talking to you.


1455
00:51:55,455 --> 00:51:58,615
But as of right now the medics need to check
your kids out and make sure your kids aren't


1456
00:51:58,675 --> 00:52:00,795
hurt. Yes, sir. You're right. Thank you.


1457
00:52:00,795 --> 00:52:02,895
'Cause I just want you to know, like,


1458
00:52:04,155 --> 00:52:05,755
within three to four minutes they could've
died.


1459
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:08,495
Especially with no water, especially with
nothing.


1460
00:52:08,495 --> 00:52:09,495
They had water. They-


1461
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:09,775
But-


1462
00:52:09,775 --> 00:52:11,855
... I know, but that's not the point.


1463
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:12,435
How old are they? How old are they?


1464
00:52:12,695 --> 00:52:12,875
Uh,


1465
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:16,695
four and... Or five and fucking four.


1466
00:52:16,715 --> 00:52:19,115
So a five and four-year-old in a hot car.


1467
00:52:19,695 --> 00:52:20,375
I know.


1468
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,535
Have a seat. H- have a seat. But you need to
understand, if I have a four-year-old in a


1469
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:29,375
hot car like that, okay, look, listen to me,
they're not gonna think to drink water.


1470
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:31,535
They're not gonna think to do any of that.


1471
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:35,135
All right?


1472
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:40,015
So from the outside looking in, 'cause we've
all dealt with this before,


1473
00:52:43,095 --> 00:52:44,155
it could've been very bad.


1474
00:52:50,775 --> 00:52:51,575
I'm sorry.


1475
00:52:51,575 --> 00:52:53,935
What if nobody called the police and they
died? Then what?


1476
00:52:54,615 --> 00:52:58,515
I fucked up, I already know. You don't have
to keep telling me, man.


1477
00:52:58,515 --> 00:53:01,095
I fucked up, I fucked up, I fucked up.


1478
00:53:02,155 --> 00:53:03,275
10-46.


1479
00:53:03,775 --> 00:53:05,835
Yeah, yeah, it's a 8 car vacuum.


1480
00:53:07,215 --> 00:53:07,935
10-4.


1481
00:53:08,015 --> 00:53:08,875
Where are you guys living?


1482
00:53:09,915 --> 00:53:13,035
We were living in Menard but one of my
friends finally


1483
00:53:13,035 --> 00:53:13,115
I'm


1484
00:53:19,215 --> 00:53:19,995
BR Back Malls.


1485
00:53:20,855 --> 00:53:25,835
The man had claimed he was only inside the
store for five minutes, but even that short


1486
00:53:25,855 --> 00:53:30,115
time was dangerous. The kids were drenched in
sweat, red-faced and clearly overheated.


1487
00:53:30,115 --> 00:53:34,975
Temperatures inside a parked car can rise by
20 degrees in just 10 minutes


1488
00:53:35,115 --> 00:53:36,695
even with the windows cracked.


1489
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:37,975
I think they're fine. They're fine.


1490
00:53:38,135 --> 00:53:39,195
No, guys, I was about to ask you, are they
fine?


1491
00:53:39,195 --> 00:53:40,775
We're trying to cool 'em down and everything.


1492
00:53:40,775 --> 00:53:40,995
Yeah.


1493
00:53:41,495 --> 00:53:44,235
And, uh, I mean, if, are they going back with
him?


1494
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:48,675
As a, right now, I don't know because it's, I
don't know if I can trust them going back


1495
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:50,555
with him. That's what I'm wondering 'cause
then-


1496
00:53:50,555 --> 00:53:51,675
At this point. Yeah. 'Cause he said he was
only in there for-


1497
00:53:51,675 --> 00:53:51,695
So...


1498
00:53:51,775 --> 00:53:53,155
He said he was only in there for five
minutes.


1499
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:57,835
I said, "Even five minutes," I said, "out in
this heat with your windows up with, with no


1500
00:53:57,835 --> 00:53:59,535
A- AC going," I said, "you could've killed
your kids easily."


1501
00:53:59,895 --> 00:54:02,175
Yeah. And he said five to 10. I'm not really
sure.


1502
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:04,855
Yeah. I mean, they're sweaty, they're warm.


1503
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:08,995
But I was thinking, I was telling him, they,
I don't think they need to go to the hospital


1504
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,095
but if they- Well, I was about to say, I was
about to ask you guys.


1505
00:54:10,555 --> 00:54:14,215
If they take them for, for we need to take
them for their safety down there, then that's


1506
00:54:14,215 --> 00:54:14,795
fine. I think medically-


1507
00:54:14,855 --> 00:54:14,875
Okay


1508
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:16,095
... they're, they're probably okay.


1509
00:54:16,095 --> 00:54:17,215
Okay. See, they're medically okay?


1510
00:54:18,715 --> 00:54:21,755
Yeah, they're very, like, your face is all,
you saw all the red and sweating and...


1511
00:54:21,915 --> 00:54:24,795
Do you want me to go in there and ask them
'cause he's standing, it sounded like he was


1512
00:54:24,815 --> 00:54:25,195
at the counter for a while.


1513
00:54:25,755 --> 00:54:26,015
Oh.


1514
00:54:26,135 --> 00:54:26,415
What, what-


1515
00:54:26,415 --> 00:54:27,055
You mean in the store?


1516
00:54:27,175 --> 00:54:28,475
Yeah, like, how long he was in there for.


1517
00:54:28,495 --> 00:54:29,495
Oh, yeah. Yeah, if you don't mind doing that.


1518
00:54:29,735 --> 00:54:31,415
Might be security camera by the, uh-


1519
00:54:31,655 --> 00:54:32,115
Well, so..


1520
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:34,835
... by the door too. If he's been in, if...


1521
00:54:35,015 --> 00:54:38,375
This is some, this will be my call, like I
said, I'll, I'll talk to you about it too.


1522
00:54:38,615 --> 00:54:42,315
If he was in there for more than 10 minutes,
I think they should go get checked medically


1523
00:54:42,315 --> 00:54:43,235
too. Yeah. Well, yeah, if it's more than 10
minutes, then uh...


1524
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:43,695
Because this,


1525
00:54:45,575 --> 00:54:47,635
because this, he's saying, he told me five to
10, but.


1526
00:54:48,255 --> 00:54:50,855
He originally told me five and then now he's
saying five to 10.


1527
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:55,135
So, I'm guessing probably a lot. 'Cause he
said he went in there to exchange, to return


1528
00:54:55,155 --> 00:54:57,115
something and he was in there for a while
trying to work on exchanging it.


1529
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:57,815
So,


1530
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,995
we all know how that can go.


1531
00:55:01,095 --> 00:55:01,635
Right. Alright.


1532
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:03,535
But I'm mainly concerned how is making sure
they're okay.


1533
00:55:03,715 --> 00:55:07,195
Like, I don't, like, that's not even mean but
I don't, I don't care about that. Yeah.


1534
00:55:07,195 --> 00:55:09,395
Yeah. Like I said, medically, I, I think
they're fine.


1535
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:09,755
They need-


1536
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:10,035
Yeah


1537
00:55:10,035 --> 00:55:13,655
... probably honestly need some, like, water
to get all those fluids, um.


1538
00:55:14,185 --> 00:55:15,125
It's just me, that's about all you'll hear.


1539
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:19,825
But I just wondered for their safety if they,
we need to take them somewhere, I'm s- more


1540
00:55:19,845 --> 00:55:20,146
than willing to do that.


1541
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:20,445
Yeah.


1542
00:55:20,465 --> 00:55:21,825
Medically, though, I think they're-


1543
00:55:22,326 --> 00:55:22,545
Okay


1544
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:23,565
... obviously hot.


1545
00:55:23,685 --> 00:55:28,425
Soon his lie came out. Lying when there are
witnesses never works out well, does it?


1546
00:55:28,425 --> 00:55:28,745
[whoosh]


1547
00:55:28,745 --> 00:55:31,366
The cashier said 15 plus, at least.


1548
00:55:31,366 --> 00:55:34,306
Oh, yeah. They need to go, they need to get
to a doctor, probably get checked in at that


1549
00:55:35,106 --> 00:55:37,125
point. So the cashier said 15 plus, at least.


1550
00:55:39,145 --> 00:55:39,725
So, at-


1551
00:55:39,805 --> 00:55:42,285
Yes, 15 plus, I think they should go get
checked-


1552
00:55:42,366 --> 00:55:42,466
Round it down


1553
00:55:42,466 --> 00:55:43,325
... by doctors at that point.


1554
00:55:43,485 --> 00:55:43,505
It's significant.


1555
00:55:43,505 --> 00:55:44,085
Because that's...


1556
00:55:45,165 --> 00:55:45,765
Yeah, he's...


1557
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:46,726
No.


1558
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,765
Well, his first worry was, uh, "Am I in
trouble?"


1559
00:55:49,405 --> 00:55:51,186
Yeah. Why, why are you worried about if
you're in trouble and not your kids?


1560
00:55:51,225 --> 00:55:51,605
Right.


1561
00:55:52,685 --> 00:55:54,765
You need an exchange when you're taking three
kids in there.


1562
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:55,505
Yeah, exactly.


1563
00:55:55,505 --> 00:55:55,925
An exchange.


1564
00:55:55,925 --> 00:55:57,706
See, that's, that's about my thoughts, yeah.


1565
00:55:58,205 --> 00:55:58,225
Yeah.


1566
00:55:58,225 --> 00:56:01,445
And he said, "Well, they have water." I said,
I said, "You think a three and a f- however


1567
00:56:01,446 --> 00:56:03,725
old they are, four to six year old or
whatever he said, is going to think about the


1568
00:56:03,745 --> 00:56:04,005
drink water?" Yeah.


1569
00:56:05,165 --> 00:56:07,565
I'm so sorry. [crying] I just love them.


1570
00:56:08,606 --> 00:56:09,505
Where's their mama?


1571
00:56:11,505 --> 00:56:12,385
They didn't know.


1572
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:14,785
Okay. Is that why you have temporary custody?


1573
00:56:16,385 --> 00:56:19,685
It's hard, man. I'm sorry. I fucked up.


1574
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:21,705
Can I hit my vape?


1575
00:56:21,805 --> 00:56:22,065
Yeah.


1576
00:56:22,985 --> 00:56:24,965
Can I grab it? It's over there.


1577
00:56:25,365 --> 00:56:25,386
What's that?


1578
00:56:25,425 --> 00:56:26,886
It's the blue American one.


1579
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:33,066
It's in the cen- in the center. Um,
there's... I ain't gonna lie to you, there's


1580
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:37,646
doobies in there. Oh, no. Those are nothing.


1581
00:56:41,825 --> 00:56:45,645
I honestly thought I had left because I
didn't believe it.


1582
00:56:46,126 --> 00:56:49,426
You know how some of the older cars, you can
flip them on and pull the key out?


1583
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,625
I can flip it on and I can pull the key out.


1584
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:52,885
It wasn't on when I got here.


1585
00:56:52,905 --> 00:56:55,505
I know. I realized that as soon as I came
out.


1586
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:57,045
I was the first-


1587
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:59,305
You realize it's probably over 100 degrees in
that car when I pulled up?


1588
00:57:00,845 --> 00:57:04,825
I mean, that takes two seconds to kill child-
children those age. You know that, right?


1589
00:57:06,765 --> 00:57:09,585
I didn't realize I fucked up. I'm sorry.


1590
00:57:09,585 --> 00:57:15,645
Can


1591
00:57:15,665 --> 00:57:17,465
I give them a hug please? They were-


1592
00:57:17,465 --> 00:57:18,125
They'll be out in a minute.


1593
00:57:18,125 --> 00:57:18,565
... very important.


1594
00:57:18,765 --> 00:57:20,585
They'll be out in a minute. Just hang out
right here.


1595
00:57:24,425 --> 00:57:27,545
How, how long did the... How long did you see
them in there?


1596
00:57:28,065 --> 00:57:32,985
Um, well, I got here and I immediately
started walking up to the store, but then I


1597
00:57:33,025 --> 00:57:37,485
heard crying and I turned back and sure as,
sure as hell the call was unattended. So


1598
00:57:37,865 --> 00:57:37,885
that's when I called 911. Okay.


1599
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:39,605
And about... That was about from the time I
made till-


1600
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:39,705
Okay


1601
00:57:39,705 --> 00:57:43,305
... the call to when you guys got here. So,
probably like five minutes by the time I got


1602
00:57:43,665 --> 00:57:44,285
here. So, probably like five minutes by the
time I got here. Yeah? Okay.


1603
00:57:44,485 --> 00:57:45,205
That's all right.


1604
00:57:45,225 --> 00:57:45,265
All right.


1605
00:57:45,265 --> 00:57:45,785
Well, I appreciate it.


1606
00:57:45,805 --> 00:57:47,125
Thanks for helping us. We're safe because of
ya.


1607
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:49,025
Absolutely. No, thank you. Appreciate it.


1608
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:50,505
I'm so sorry.


1609
00:57:54,185 --> 00:57:56,305
I really should have just waited until
tomorrow.


1610
00:57:59,345 --> 00:58:04,185
Officers decided to detain him, especially
after learning he may have been smoking


1611
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:05,905
marijuana while responsible for the children.


1612
00:58:06,225 --> 00:58:06,505
Huh?


1613
00:58:06,545 --> 00:58:07,445
Just don't walk around.


1614
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,365
Fucking 92 degrees, dude.


1615
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:16,445
I know. And I went in there... Do you hear
this? I went in there and talked to the


1616
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,245
cashier that... She said he was waiting in
line for 15 minutes.


1617
00:58:19,345 --> 00:58:20,585
No. Are you fucking serious?


1618
00:58:20,645 --> 00:58:20,965
Yeah.


1619
00:58:21,345 --> 00:58:23,045
I mean, they were all sweaty and shit, but
uh-


1620
00:58:23,065 --> 00:58:24,165
Well, at least they're still sweating.


1621
00:58:25,365 --> 00:58:25,925
Oh, yeah.


1622
00:58:26,705 --> 00:58:26,725
Oh, yeah.


1623
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:28,365
I know.


1624
00:58:28,365 --> 00:58:28,405
Somebody should have woken up yelling.


1625
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:29,925
I'll probably hear there's child
endangerment, dude.


1626
00:58:31,065 --> 00:58:34,045
Uh, yeah. And, and so we're trying to figure
out... He's...


1627
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:36,205
I don't know if he's on the phone with your
sergeant or what but


1628
00:58:37,425 --> 00:58:40,965
we're trying to figure out where they need to
go, if they need to go, because like-


1629
00:58:41,065 --> 00:58:41,945
Children's services?


1630
00:58:42,245 --> 00:58:42,545
We don't even-


1631
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:43,185
He doesn't have a mom.


1632
00:58:43,845 --> 00:58:48,685
Well, if you're... If you're gonna not charge
him with anything and move on, then we can't


1633
00:58:48,705 --> 00:58:49,625
really take his kids away from him.


1634
00:58:49,905 --> 00:58:50,985
Oh, I know. That's what I'm saying. Right.


1635
00:58:51,085 --> 00:58:51,325
But-


1636
00:58:51,425 --> 00:58:51,905
Which I think


1637
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:52,865
But when child endangerment comes in.


1638
00:58:52,865 --> 00:58:53,245
... he's not important enough though.


1639
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:53,845
Absolutely.


1640
00:58:55,285 --> 00:58:58,585
I mean, medically, they just did their
temperatures. Like their temperature's normal


1641
00:58:58,605 --> 00:59:00,285
at this point. Now they've been to the medic.
So, you know, get-


1642
00:59:00,485 --> 00:59:01,885
Ah. You didn't take them when they first got
out?


1643
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:02,305
No.


1644
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:02,525
Okay.


1645
00:59:03,525 --> 00:59:04,865
They were normal before then.


1646
00:59:04,905 --> 00:59:07,365
Yeah, yeah. I understand.


1647
00:59:07,565 --> 00:59:07,665
What you guys doing, sir?


1648
00:59:07,665 --> 00:59:08,305
Everything on you?


1649
00:59:08,765 --> 00:59:08,945
Okay.


1650
00:59:09,305 --> 00:59:11,105
Yeah, I'll patch you down for both of you.
Turn around, please.


1651
00:59:12,145 --> 00:59:12,165
Am I going to jail?


1652
00:59:12,165 --> 00:59:13,865
We're gonna talk about it. I'm gonna detain
you right now, okay?


1653
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:13,985
Okay.


1654
00:59:15,505 --> 00:59:16,285
What's going in your pockets?


1655
00:59:19,485 --> 00:59:21,025
You mind if I take everything out?


1656
00:59:24,605 --> 00:59:25,505
No drugs or anything?


1657
00:59:27,025 --> 00:59:27,045
No.


1658
00:59:27,045 --> 00:59:28,725
I got weed. That's fine. Weed's legal.


1659
00:59:29,325 --> 00:59:31,625
You're not driving with the kids in the car
while you're smoking marijuana, right?


1660
00:59:35,205 --> 00:59:37,365
That's right. Okay, sir, I've lived a lot to
get to where I'm at.


1661
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,085
I can't tell-


1662
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:42,745
All right, you're gonna have a seat in the
back of my car right now.


1663
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:44,205
Are they okay?


1664
00:59:44,705 --> 00:59:45,385
Yeah, they're okay.


1665
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:47,485
We're just detaining you for right now.


1666
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:53,865
It's funny, I actually just was there for a
return the other day. The drug conflict is


1667
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:54,965
why I walked in. Oh, yeah?


1668
00:59:55,605 --> 00:59:56,705
The kids weren't in the car were they?


1669
00:59:57,125 --> 00:59:57,445
No.


1670
00:59:57,465 --> 00:59:58,905
Oh, okay. He was trying to attend to us.


1671
00:59:58,905 --> 01:00:00,605
I left, uh, I left her at home by herself.


1672
01:00:01,465 --> 01:00:02,725
Where's their mom at right now?


1673
01:00:03,125 --> 01:00:03,425
I have no clue.


1674
01:00:04,065 --> 01:00:04,885
Do you know her phone number?


1675
01:00:05,265 --> 01:00:06,265
No, not right now.


1676
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:07,065
Do they have a grandma?


1677
01:00:07,805 --> 01:00:08,205
Grandpa?


1678
01:00:08,225 --> 01:00:09,105
Yeah, grandma.


1679
01:00:09,965 --> 01:00:10,565
That's close?


1680
01:00:10,645 --> 01:00:10,985
Yeah.


1681
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:12,345
Is she able to take care of them?


1682
01:00:13,025 --> 01:00:14,305
Are you... Am I going to jail?


1683
01:00:14,465 --> 01:00:17,945
Yeah. You're gonna go to jail for child
endangerment, man. Can't leave your kids in


1684
01:00:18,665 --> 01:00:19,545
here. You know Grandma's phone number?


1685
01:00:19,625 --> 01:00:20,045
Yeah.


1686
01:00:20,085 --> 01:00:21,265
All right. Give me, give me a second.


1687
01:00:22,325 --> 01:00:23,225
What's your grandma's phone number?


1688
01:00:23,345 --> 01:00:27,305
Can I please give them a hug? Because I know
their mom's gonna keep them from me after


1689
01:00:27,345 --> 01:00:27,365
this. All right.


1690
01:00:27,365 --> 01:00:28,245
Please, just one hug.


1691
01:00:28,565 --> 01:00:30,905
What's your grandma's number? Step out real
quick. I'm gonna put you in handcuffs.


1692
01:00:30,945 --> 01:00:32,685
Can I please give them a hug before you do
that?


1693
01:00:32,685 --> 01:00:35,465
All right, no, please. Turn around. Turn.


1694
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:40,225
You should have thought about all this before
you, you did a dumb step, man.


1695
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:41,405
What do you... I...


1696
01:00:43,505 --> 01:00:44,005
You're right,


1697
01:00:44,685 --> 01:00:47,145
you're right. It's my fault. I'm sorry.


1698
01:00:49,585 --> 01:00:50,265
Those too tight?


1699
01:00:51,365 --> 01:00:52,145
Is it hot back here?


1700
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:57,085
Even if it was, I wouldn't tell you because I
fucking deserve it.


1701
01:00:58,845 --> 01:00:59,565
All right, have a seat.


1702
01:00:59,765 --> 01:01:00,805
Did you get ahold of my mom?


1703
01:01:01,385 --> 01:01:04,185
No. I think, uh, they're gonna get dropped
off at Doctors Hospital.


1704
01:01:04,865 --> 01:01:05,645
And they're okay?


1705
01:01:05,805 --> 01:01:07,245
Yeah, they're okay. But it was just...


1706
01:01:07,245 --> 01:01:08,885
We don't have anyone else to take them right
now and then-


1707
01:01:09,145 --> 01:01:10,425
Can we take them to my mom's?


1708
01:01:11,525 --> 01:01:13,345
No, they're gonna go to the doctor's, make
sure they're all good.


1709
01:01:13,885 --> 01:01:16,885
And then, uh, Children's Services is gonna go
there as well.


1710
01:01:17,525 --> 01:01:20,045
So we, we have to report on something like
this, man.


1711
01:01:20,045 --> 01:01:20,405
It's not like-


1712
01:01:20,405 --> 01:01:21,025
I know you do, but still.


1713
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:22,805
It's not like, "Oh, you messed up. Okay,
here's your kids back."


1714
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:25,536
... go do it again. You know,


1715
01:01:26,196 --> 01:01:30,035
it's something we, we are required.
Otherwise, I don't, I'm not, I'm not gonna


1716
01:01:30,075 --> 01:01:30,295
lose my job over something like this.


1717
01:01:30,515 --> 01:01:31,435
I know, I know, and...


1718
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:34,035
So from my understanding, you're, you're
doing a return for this gentleman?


1719
01:01:34,355 --> 01:01:38,495
I refused to do a return, because he used
half the product and he must have


1720
01:01:38,855 --> 01:01:40,215
communicated that,


1721
01:01:40,976 --> 01:01:43,535
that like they, they, they usually would
handle that.


1722
01:01:43,535 --> 01:01:43,835
Mm-hmm.


1723
01:01:43,895 --> 01:01:47,315
They asked me 'cause I'm a leader on duty,
not just because I served him.


1724
01:01:47,775 --> 01:01:47,796
Yeah.


1725
01:01:47,796 --> 01:01:52,615
But they asked me, "Can he return it if it's
half empty?" And I was like, "No, I did not


1726
01:01:53,155 --> 01:01:55,655
say that he could return it if he used it, I
just said if it was 15..."


1727
01:01:55,655 --> 01:01:59,615
Yeah. So real quick, if you don't mind, could
you do a witness statement for me stating


1728
01:01:59,636 --> 01:02:02,755
like, like he came in here to return the
product where it was, and like, you don't


1729
01:02:03,035 --> 01:02:05,115
have to go into too much detail, but just
like, just give us like a rough estimate time


1730
01:02:05,136 --> 01:02:05,395
he was in here. Okay.


1731
01:02:05,715 --> 01:02:07,736
Because he's telling us a totally different
time.


1732
01:02:08,235 --> 01:02:09,195
I can check the camera.


1733
01:02:09,215 --> 01:02:11,375
Then what... Yeah, and if you guys have
camera footage as well.


1734
01:02:11,395 --> 01:02:13,655
Yeah, I can check the camera and see when he
came in and he was


1735
01:02:14,456 --> 01:02:16,435
right there kind of in camera view, I can go
back-


1736
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:19,476
Yeah, and if you could just give us like a
rough estimate time too, like he was in here


1737
01:02:19,495 --> 01:02:21,075
approximately this time trying to do this and
everything else.


1738
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:23,515
Okay. You know, I can, uh, I can just
backtrack on the camera and get you like a


1739
01:02:23,615 --> 01:02:23,975
time. Okay.


1740
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:24,355
Uh, yeah.


1741
01:02:24,355 --> 01:02:25,695
It doesn't have anything to do with the
return.


1742
01:02:25,735 --> 01:02:25,895
Okay.


1743
01:02:25,915 --> 01:02:27,375
Yeah, i- i- this is a, this is-


1744
01:02:27,375 --> 01:02:28,555
I'm like, "How did I just ruin this guy's
life?"


1745
01:02:28,555 --> 01:02:30,475
No, no, this is something totally different.


1746
01:02:30,475 --> 01:02:30,755
[laughs] Okay.


1747
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:31,475
Thank you so much.


1748
01:02:31,475 --> 01:02:32,395
All right, I'll run it.


1749
01:02:32,395 --> 01:02:37,075
The store employee confirmed that the man had
been in the store for more than 27 minutes


1750
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:39,855
and only left when he noticed the police had
arrived.


1751
01:02:39,995 --> 01:02:42,395
He was then charged with child endangerment.


1752
01:02:42,495 --> 01:02:46,875
The children were taken to the hospital and
later placed under the care of CPS.


1753
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:52,035
It's easy to ask, "How could a parent do
this?" But by the time officers arrive, the


1754
01:02:52,035 --> 01:02:56,835
worst has often already happened. Kids left
in hot cars, extreme neglect, drug-related


1755
01:02:56,895 --> 01:03:01,835
chaos. What might seem like an overreaction
can be the difference between life and death.


1756
01:03:01,855 --> 01:03:06,775
It's rarely black and white. Officers have to
make split-second decisions under intense


1757
01:03:06,835 --> 01:03:11,695
pressure. Before we jump into the next story,
don't forget to hit that subscribe button so


1758
01:03:11,695 --> 01:03:12,615
you never miss these shocking moments.


1759
01:03:12,775 --> 01:03:14,235
95 16.


1760
01:03:15,075 --> 01:03:16,175
Fairborn Police Department.


1761
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:22,555
On January 1st, 2024, police in Fairborn,
Ohio responded


1762
01:03:22,675 --> 01:03:25,835
to a 911 call that quickly turned into a
nightmare.


1763
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:29,835
A mother had called for help but she gave a
fake name, which immediately raised


1764
01:03:29,995 --> 01:03:34,775
suspicions. When officers arrived at the
scene, they found a three-year-old girl in


1765
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:39,235
critical condition inside a filthy,
bug-infested apartment.


1766
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:40,535
Fairborn Police Department.


1767
01:03:43,175 --> 01:03:45,775
Holy shit, she's breathing, she's still
breathing. Let's go, let's go.


1768
01:03:49,035 --> 01:03:53,995
Upon arriving at the scene, the child's
father told police the mother called him


1769
01:03:54,075 --> 01:03:58,375
crying that their daughter was starving then
vanished. He hadn't seen the girl in weeks.


1770
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:01,835
She had already lost one child to CPS in the
past.


1771
01:04:01,895 --> 01:04:06,495
Now, their second daughter was fighting for
her life and the mother had gone silent.


1772
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:09,395
Her phone on airplane mode, nowhere to be
found.


1773
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:10,655
So there we go.


1774
01:04:11,015 --> 01:04:13,495
So how did you come to find yourself over
here?


1775
01:04:13,555 --> 01:04:16,015
She called me and was freaking out,


1776
01:04:16,855 --> 01:04:21,435
telling me that my daughter was malnourished
and that she was sorry


1777
01:04:22,215 --> 01:04:23,175
and she had to go.


1778
01:04:23,655 --> 01:04:24,535
Where would she go?


1779
01:04:25,155 --> 01:04:25,915
I have no idea.


1780
01:04:26,675 --> 01:04:29,995
You know, her mom lives in Yellow Springs,
um, in the, uh,


1781
01:04:31,195 --> 01:04:31,755
the, um,


1782
01:04:32,575 --> 01:04:34,595
apartments over there by the horse track.


1783
01:04:38,355 --> 01:04:39,415
Is my daughter okay?


1784
01:04:40,195 --> 01:04:42,755
Well, she's en route to Children's Hospital
right now.


1785
01:04:43,895 --> 01:04:45,035
Do you have an ID on you, partner?


1786
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:45,535
I do.


1787
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:47,935
What is your daughter's name?


1788
01:04:47,935 --> 01:04:49,935
[beep]


1789
01:04:50,575 --> 01:04:50,955
Okay.


1790
01:04:51,435 --> 01:04:53,195
Check that out, also, like...


1791
01:04:53,955 --> 01:04:55,015
Where would she be going?


1792
01:04:55,315 --> 01:04:56,315
I have no idea. She's-


1793
01:04:56,315 --> 01:04:57,675
She has no family around here or-


1794
01:04:57,735 --> 01:04:58,055
So,


1795
01:04:58,835 --> 01:05:00,895
like I said, her mom lives in Yellow Springs


1796
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:02,555
and, uh,


1797
01:05:03,335 --> 01:05:05,155
I don't know where her sister lives anymore.


1798
01:05:05,875 --> 01:05:08,795
I know that she's been talking to a lot of
people online.


1799
01:05:08,795 --> 01:05:10,235
Can I get a picture of this eventually?


1800
01:05:11,075 --> 01:05:13,775
Okay, I'll just give it back to you for now,
so don't...


1801
01:05:15,415 --> 01:05:16,775
You got a number? I can send it to you.


1802
01:05:19,555 --> 01:05:20,595
Just a screenshot?


1803
01:05:21,135 --> 01:05:21,375
Yeah.


1804
01:05:21,615 --> 01:05:22,315
Okay, yeah.


1805
01:05:22,975 --> 01:05:23,475
I'll use my


1806
01:05:24,435 --> 01:05:25,095
work phone.


1807
01:05:26,035 --> 01:05:26,695
Yeah, um,


1808
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:30,355
she's been talking to a lot of guys online,
she's been-


1809
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:30,655
Ready?


1810
01:05:31,095 --> 01:05:31,395
Yeah.


1811
01:05:31,395 --> 01:05:37,235
[beep]


1812
01:05:37,615 --> 01:05:40,815
Getting AIDS on Destiny all night, said
didn't think this was gonna happen.


1813
01:05:40,815 --> 01:05:45,235
[beep]


1814
01:05:56,795 --> 01:05:58,415
When's the last time you saw your daughter?


1815
01:05:59,195 --> 01:06:01,375
It's been a while. She, um,


1816
01:06:02,335 --> 01:06:07,295
had kept telling me that she didn't want me
around her because she had had issues of


1817
01:06:07,295 --> 01:06:12,255
being raped when she was a child. And that
because of that, she was uncomfortable with


1818
01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:17,095
us being in the same room. Gave me reasons to
why she was asleep every time I came over,


1819
01:06:17,155 --> 01:06:17,575
and I haven't seen her in at least two, three
weeks.


1820
01:06:18,595 --> 01:06:20,055
Okay, and when you saw her-


1821
01:06:20,135 --> 01:06:20,875
I just seen her.


1822
01:06:20,875 --> 01:06:24,735
And when you saw her two or three weeks ago,
her, she was in good health or...


1823
01:06:24,975 --> 01:06:25,575
She wasn't.


1824
01:06:25,975 --> 01:06:26,255
Okay.


1825
01:06:26,255 --> 01:06:27,255
As far as I was aware.


1826
01:06:27,395 --> 01:06:28,275
And, and


1827
01:06:29,335 --> 01:06:31,815
so does she have drug problems or what's
going on?


1828
01:06:32,395 --> 01:06:35,375
Um, she smokes pot, but I don't think that's
the cause of it.


1829
01:06:35,775 --> 01:06:40,595
Uh, about, I wanna say six months ago, we
split up because her


1830
01:06:40,655 --> 01:06:42,675
father died and she


1831
01:06:43,755 --> 01:06:46,335
went completely off rails after that.


1832
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:50,455
She stopped cleaning, she stopped taking care
of everything, that led to many arguments.


1833
01:06:50,595 --> 01:06:53,155
Um, she had asked me to quit my job two years
prior


1834
01:06:54,055 --> 01:06:57,435
and, uh, I listened because she was making
like $1,000 a week.


1835
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:02,775
And, uh, so I told her, you know, because I
knew she was struggling, "Get me


1836
01:07:02,775 --> 01:07:07,515
clothes. I will go get a job. I will take
care of everything." And she said, "No, I


1837
01:07:07,515 --> 01:07:12,115
want you to stay here." And it kept turning
into fights until I caught her cheating with,


1838
01:07:13,135 --> 01:07:17,795
or on me with some people online. And, uh,
she's just been in this, in this spiral. She


1839
01:07:17,955 --> 01:07:18,895
hasn't cleaned up the room. The last time
I... [beep]


1840
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:23,535
Uh, but she doesn't clean her own room.


1841
01:07:23,535 --> 01:07:28,355
I think the only reason she cleaned that room
is because I told her that it, I'd, I'd


1842
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:32,381
seriously fucking hurt her if I found my
daughter in any kind of condition....


1843
01:07:32,402 --> 01:07:35,662
because we lost our first daughter because
she had neglect issues.


1844
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,401
And, uh, that was the reason we were allowed
to keep this one.


1845
01:07:39,961 --> 01:07:40,641
And, uh-


1846
01:07:42,921 --> 01:07:46,841
You lost your first daughter, like she... you
had to put her up for adoption or...


1847
01:07:46,841 --> 01:07:47,421
Yeah, yeah.


1848
01:07:47,442 --> 01:07:47,582
Okay.


1849
01:07:47,601 --> 01:07:52,521
CPS took her because we were... I had taken
her to my uncle's and


1850
01:07:52,521 --> 01:07:54,541
an old friend of mine that I looked at like a
brother


1851
01:07:55,181 --> 01:07:58,681
had his gun on him and he was, uh,
ex-military.


1852
01:07:58,982 --> 01:07:59,361
So,


1853
01:08:00,621 --> 01:08:04,581
I assumed, you know, everything was fine. I
didn't know he had it on him at the time.


1854
01:08:04,701 --> 01:08:08,502
He pulled it out to clean it. I wasn't paying
attention and he shot himself in the knee.


1855
01:08:09,281 --> 01:08:09,581
Um-


1856
01:08:09,821 --> 01:08:10,201
Okay.


1857
01:08:10,201 --> 01:08:12,201
I guess it was a bullet wedged in


1858
01:08:13,121 --> 01:08:17,121
where he was trying to dislodge and the
handle cocked forward and stabbed the bullet


1859
01:08:17,121 --> 01:08:18,281
in his knee. And because of that,


1860
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:24,221
along with, uh, they said that she had marks
on her back, which I had assumed was from


1861
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:27,201
flailing in her stroller, that, uh, they
needed to take custody.


1862
01:08:28,521 --> 01:08:32,561
Okay. Would, would you humor me? I know she
said that her,


1863
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:37,961
her, uh, phone's going on airplane mode, but
can you text her back and say, "Hey, I'm


1864
01:08:38,061 --> 01:08:42,101
talking to the police, like, you need to come
back here," or something to that effect?


1865
01:08:42,741 --> 01:08:43,781
Thank you. Okay, I'll be right back.


1866
01:08:44,041 --> 01:08:48,522
While searching the house, they uncovered a
horrifying case of extreme


1867
01:08:48,581 --> 01:08:52,921
neglect and abuse that had been hidden behind
the walls of that home.


1868
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:57,461
29516.


1869
01:08:58,262 --> 01:08:59,401
Fairborn Police Department.


1870
01:09:01,881 --> 01:09:01,901
Okay.


1871
01:09:01,901 --> 01:09:03,202
Fairborn Police Department.


1872
01:09:07,241 --> 01:09:08,322
Fairborn Police.


1873
01:09:10,122 --> 01:09:11,562
Which one is it? Left?


1874
01:09:12,001 --> 01:09:12,181
B.


1875
01:09:12,241 --> 01:09:14,321
This is like the old, the older lady...


1876
01:09:15,581 --> 01:09:17,401
Uh, they always come out here and check.


1877
01:09:18,102 --> 01:09:18,901
Nobody's answering.


1878
01:09:18,901 --> 01:09:19,921
All right, let's go in.


1879
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:22,341
Yeah, we're-


1880
01:09:22,381 --> 01:09:23,501
Fairborn Police.


1881
01:09:24,081 --> 01:09:25,382
Fairborn Police Department.


1882
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:31,702
305.


1883
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:36,141
This is our fed.


1884
01:09:36,941 --> 01:09:37,321
Good.


1885
01:09:42,401 --> 01:09:46,541
I'm not gonna call the number back, but older
male answered the phone-


1886
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:47,741
Oh fuck.


1887
01:09:47,741 --> 01:09:49,201
... and said that he has no idea who-


1888
01:09:49,261 --> 01:09:49,401
Oh


1889
01:09:49,401 --> 01:09:52,142
... Ariella is and no one needs his phone.


1890
01:09:52,161 --> 01:09:52,581
However-


1891
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:53,421
Oh my, oh


1892
01:09:53,421 --> 01:09:55,221
... this is the phone number that came up on
the 911.


1893
01:09:55,261 --> 01:09:56,142
Oh, goddamn


1894
01:09:57,621 --> 01:09:58,501
it. Motherfucker.


1895
01:09:59,881 --> 01:10:01,001
Fairborn Police.


1896
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:04,642
Oh, fuck.


1897
01:10:04,642 --> 01:10:07,222
305, she was on Wallace.


1898
01:10:07,521 --> 01:10:07,981
I'll go.


1899
01:10:09,841 --> 01:10:11,841
When she called according to the


1900
01:10:12,681 --> 01:10:13,601
geo verify.


1901
01:10:16,081 --> 01:10:17,182
Holy shit, she's breathing.


1902
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:18,661
Let's go, let's go.


1903
01:10:23,561 --> 01:10:24,422
She's still breathing.


1904
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:27,141
Get a light.


1905
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:28,681
Ah.


1906
01:10:35,521 --> 01:10:37,521
Right here, yeah, she's still breathing. I'll
get out of your way, sorry.


1907
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:39,961
Yeah, I'm getting out of the way.


1908
01:10:39,981 --> 01:10:41,201
Holy cow.


1909
01:10:41,261 --> 01:10:42,761
I'd say just pick up and let's go.


1910
01:10:42,761 --> 01:10:43,022
Yeah.


1911
01:10:43,061 --> 01:10:44,841
Yeah. What are these fucking bugs here?


1912
01:10:45,862 --> 01:10:46,102
Hmm?


1913
01:10:46,161 --> 01:10:46,581
Okay.


1914
01:10:47,061 --> 01:10:47,742
Oh, fuck.


1915
01:10:51,341 --> 01:10:51,922
295.


1916
01:10:51,942 --> 01:10:53,142
Oh my God.


1917
01:10:54,121 --> 01:10:57,042
Does anyone live here?


1918
01:10:57,722 --> 01:10:58,161
What the...


1919
01:10:58,161 --> 01:10:59,701
Let's get the fuck out of here.


1920
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:01,281
We haven't even got that far.


1921
01:11:02,301 --> 01:11:05,021
Uh, let's get pictures started. I'm going to
call Johnny.


1922
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:06,041
God...


1923
01:11:08,241 --> 01:11:10,721
Fairborn Police, if you're here, make
yourself known.


1924
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,701
Hey, can you and one of your guys respond
down here?


1925
01:11:21,701 --> 01:11:24,322
We found this kid barely alive.


1926
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:27,861
Medics are rushing, uh, the kid to the
hospital.


1927
01:11:29,261 --> 01:11:29,621
Um,


1928
01:11:31,121 --> 01:11:35,921
yep, yep, we're finishing up trying to clear
this place, but you're definitely gonna want


1929
01:11:35,941 --> 01:11:36,462
to clear this place, but you're definitely
gonna want to be down here.


1930
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:38,901
All right, thanks. Bye.


1931
01:11:41,381 --> 01:11:44,302
Yeah, I think Zach ripped that one off the
end so...


1932
01:11:44,461 --> 01:11:45,341
There was a call,


1933
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:48,961
not here and then they called back there was
a guy. Did you guys hear that part of it?


1934
01:11:49,142 --> 01:11:49,461
Yeah.


1935
01:11:49,481 --> 01:11:51,782
I was... once I saw the kid I thought he was
zoned out.


1936
01:11:51,961 --> 01:11:54,942
So, the lady who called obviously isn't here.


1937
01:11:55,161 --> 01:11:59,862
They called the number back and a guy
answered and said he has no idea who- 305.


1938
01:12:01,002 --> 01:12:01,461
Good.


1939
01:12:03,481 --> 01:12:05,381
We have a Radia


1940
01:12:06,362 --> 01:12:07,041
Jasmin


1941
01:12:08,142 --> 01:12:09,662
listed as of September 8th


1942
01:13:52,131 --> 01:13:53,632
He straight ripped that door. [sirens
blaring]


1943
01:13:53,771 --> 01:13:55,772
Paramedics rushed the girl to the hospital.


1944
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:59,532
Moments later, police located the mother,
26-year-old Ravia.


1945
01:13:59,592 --> 01:14:02,272
She was quiet, almost numb, as officers
arrested her.


1946
01:14:03,012 --> 01:14:06,991
The door's kind of ajar. I'm like, "Oh, they
said there's a kid in there. Nobody's


1947
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:07,571
answering. Let's go in."


1948
01:14:07,592 --> 01:14:07,672
Mm-hmm.


1949
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:09,451
We go in. Find the kid,


1950
01:14:10,711 --> 01:14:11,051
maybe


1951
01:14:11,771 --> 01:14:14,091
two, three, emaciated-


1952
01:14:14,272 --> 01:14:14,511
Mm-hmm


1953
01:14:14,511 --> 01:14:15,671
... covered in bites.


1954
01:14:16,551 --> 01:14:17,152
We thought


1955
01:14:17,831 --> 01:14:18,951
she or he we-


1956
01:14:19,171 --> 01:14:19,391
Mm-hmm


1957
01:14:19,391 --> 01:14:20,811
... was dead on the floor.


1958
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:21,011
Mm-hmm.


1959
01:14:21,051 --> 01:14:21,251
But


1960
01:14:22,092 --> 01:14:23,212
was barely breathing.


1961
01:14:24,331 --> 01:14:25,471
Medic scooped her up,


1962
01:14:26,531 --> 01:14:27,532
ran to the hospital.


1963
01:14:27,752 --> 01:14:28,091
Okay.


1964
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,331
This is what we have.


1965
01:14:29,951 --> 01:14:31,251
Who lives here?


1966
01:14:31,752 --> 01:14:34,771
That's what we're working on. So far as going
down to the apartment complex.


1967
01:14:35,371 --> 01:14:38,671
Uh, right now they said Radia, or something
like that.


1968
01:14:38,751 --> 01:14:41,051
It's like a pretty foreign... Just... But I
don't know.


1969
01:14:41,131 --> 01:14:41,511
Yeah.


1970
01:14:41,611 --> 01:14:43,851
This, this is her apartment? This would be-


1971
01:14:43,851 --> 01:14:45,731
Supposedly, that's what we're trying to
determine.


1972
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,431
Okay. And that's where she placed the call?


1973
01:14:47,171 --> 01:14:47,191
Ma'am-


1974
01:14:47,231 --> 01:14:51,931
Again, yes. Um, but it sounds like a male
came back on the line the second


1975
01:14:52,011 --> 01:14:53,271
time or something like that.


1976
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,971
I... Ronnie Day Jr., nothing with Radia in
there.


1977
01:14:57,371 --> 01:14:57,671
Um,


1978
01:14:58,491 --> 01:15:00,391
so that's what they're trying to determine is


1979
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,731
who, who belongs here and who called us.


1980
01:15:04,191 --> 01:15:04,211
Okay.


1981
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:07,871
Um, but we got pictures, and obviously I
called out code enforcement, so...


1982
01:15:08,231 --> 01:15:08,491
Okay.


1983
01:15:08,631 --> 01:15:12,451
Um, but yeah, if you guys wanna... I don't
know if you want to look through there.


1984
01:15:12,831 --> 01:15:14,491
I might have booties if you want 'em.


1985
01:15:14,851 --> 01:15:16,291
All right. I guess so.


1986
01:15:16,291 --> 01:15:17,631
And it was the back,


1987
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:22,971
back bedroom there with the pink shelf. The
one with, the one with the door ripped off.


1988
01:15:23,131 --> 01:15:23,471
Mm-hmm.


1989
01:15:24,051 --> 01:15:24,971
That's... Yeah.


1990
01:15:25,071 --> 01:15:25,931
You were live when you finished?


1991
01:15:25,931 --> 01:15:27,171
Yes, yes. Yeah.


1992
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:27,991
Uh, it's all


1993
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,051
... over the wall.


1994
01:15:29,111 --> 01:15:30,091
Um, so...


1995
01:15:30,091 --> 01:15:30,511
I'm gonna,


1996
01:15:31,351 --> 01:15:33,971
I'm gonna grab some boo- booties before I go
in there.


1997
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:35,911
All right. You have 10-15?


1998
01:15:36,051 --> 01:15:36,331
Huh?


1999
01:15:36,471 --> 01:15:37,451
You got the nice shoes.


2000
01:15:37,751 --> 01:15:38,151
Yeah.


2001
01:15:39,731 --> 01:15:41,811
I don't know if you heard the... Any...


2002
01:15:41,831 --> 01:15:46,611
Um, so basically we showed up here because
somebody said they found a two or


2003
01:15:47,191 --> 01:15:48,591
three-year-old breathing, hard,


2004
01:15:49,531 --> 01:15:50,511
hard to breathe-


2005
01:15:51,511 --> 01:15:52,151
At around


2006
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:53,771
10 AM


2007
01:15:54,431 --> 01:15:57,091
my ex-fiance called me to tell me my child,


2008
01:15:57,891 --> 01:16:00,331
in her care, was bleeding and unconscious-


2009
01:16:00,331 --> 01:16:00,611
Uh, B?


2010
01:16:00,611 --> 01:16:01,531
... along the same-


2011
01:16:01,591 --> 01:16:01,931
B?


2012
01:16:03,211 --> 01:16:06,211
Along the... Saying she was leaving and she
was sorry.


2013
01:16:06,231 --> 01:16:08,691
I left from my uncle's house to


2014
01:16:09,411 --> 01:16:10,171
rush over


2015
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:14,691
after telling her to calm down, only to
receive a message saying


2016
01:16:16,071 --> 01:16:20,931
she was putting her phone in airplane mode
and running off, and that she was sorry.


2017
01:16:20,931 --> 01:16:22,771
And to get my things from the apartment.


2018
01:16:22,771 --> 01:16:24,931
I arrived at the police outside her door,


2019
01:16:25,771 --> 01:16:29,011
only to find that she was gone and my child
was taken to the hospital.


2020
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:30,771
Gotcha. Well, I appreciate that, man.


2021
01:16:31,311 --> 01:16:31,451
Well, so-


2022
01:16:31,451 --> 01:16:36,271
Well, right now we're trying to figure out a
whole bunch of things, right? A whole bunch


2023
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:38,791
of things, right? A whole bunch of details.
Um... Do you mind if I sit? My back is


2024
01:16:38,791 --> 01:16:40,511
killing me. Um, what'd you, what do you want?


2025
01:16:40,811 --> 01:16:41,611
Just sit down. [laughs]


2026
01:16:42,571 --> 01:16:42,911
You can have a-


2027
01:16:43,091 --> 01:16:43,931
We're, we're-


2028
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:44,931
... seat in the back of the-


2029
01:16:45,031 --> 01:16:46,111
Yeah, we're gonna ha... You can have a seat
in the back of my car. Um...


2030
01:16:46,271 --> 01:16:47,151
Are you guys taking me?


2031
01:16:47,411 --> 01:16:47,851
What's that?


2032
01:16:47,851 --> 01:16:48,711
Are you guys taking me?


2033
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:50,951
Uh, yeah, we are. Okay?


2034
01:16:51,031 --> 01:16:51,391
Okay.


2035
01:16:52,051 --> 01:16:52,851
So, let's-


2036
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:54,031
Can I take my stuff down then, please?


2037
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:57,291
I'll, I'll take care of that. Let's, uh,
let's walk in the front of my car, all right?


2038
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:06,111
Okay, just... Right here is good. Um, if you
wanna face my car, you don't have, just put


2039
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:06,571
your hands out to your sides.


2040
01:17:07,471 --> 01:17:09,031
Nothing, nothing on your, uh,


2041
01:17:10,491 --> 01:17:11,571
in your pockets at all.


2042
01:17:12,191 --> 01:17:12,351
No shoes.


2043
01:17:12,351 --> 01:17:14,071
No pockets. You have, um,


2044
01:17:14,811 --> 01:17:16,351
just underwear underneath your sweats?


2045
01:17:17,251 --> 01:17:17,891
Just not underwear.


2046
01:17:18,011 --> 01:17:21,271
Just your sweats? Okay. Oh, perfect. [police
radio] All right.


2047
01:17:21,571 --> 01:17:23,491
Go ahead and put your palms together behind
your back.


2048
01:17:23,531 --> 01:17:24,231
322.


2049
01:17:25,191 --> 01:17:27,551
Tell me how, tell me how to say your name one
more time?


2050
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:28,571
Ravia.


2051
01:17:28,891 --> 01:17:31,491
Ravia? Okay. Ravia, my name is Ryan Rick. I'm
a detective.


2052
01:17:31,671 --> 01:17:34,111
Uh, and I am the detective that's gonna be
handling this case.


2053
01:17:34,211 --> 01:17:35,071
Can you come home now?


2054
01:17:35,391 --> 01:17:35,831
I'm sorry?


2055
01:17:36,111 --> 01:17:36,871
Can you come home now?


2056
01:17:36,911 --> 01:17:36,991
I,


2057
01:17:37,891 --> 01:17:38,671
I can't.


2058
01:17:38,671 --> 01:17:38,691
How is your family now?


2059
01:17:38,691 --> 01:17:43,251
I, I can't. Um, it's gonna be a little bit,
so right now, um, you're gonna be taken to


2060
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:48,151
the Fairborn Police Department. Uh, there's
some, some administrative things that we have


2061
01:17:48,511 --> 01:17:51,451
to do there. Uh, take a picture and some,
some fingerprints.


2062
01:17:51,451 --> 01:17:54,471
But I'm gonna be down to talk to you, uh,
soon. Okay?


2063
01:17:55,291 --> 01:17:55,311
Okay.


2064
01:17:55,331 --> 01:17:55,731
All right.


2065
01:17:56,771 --> 01:17:59,511
We'll work through it.


2066
01:18:00,591 --> 01:18:02,391
But I don't know what for it.


2067
01:18:03,011 --> 01:18:06,451
So I, I can't, I can't give you an answer
like that only because I don't know.


2068
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:08,391
Um, but...


2069
01:18:09,211 --> 01:18:13,911
Okay. All right, very good. Again, I will be
down to talk to you, uh, in just a little


2070
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:14,911
while. All right? Okay.


2071
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:16,691
These aren't too tight, are they?


2072
01:18:17,871 --> 01:18:17,891
No, they're fine.


2073
01:18:17,891 --> 01:18:20,991
Okay. Let's go around to the passenger side
here.


2074
01:18:22,931 --> 01:18:25,011
And have a seat. What's this fella's name
back here?


2075
01:18:25,271 --> 01:18:25,791
Travis.


2076
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:25,811
Travis.


2077
01:18:25,811 --> 01:18:29,151
Can you please tell him that that stuff right
there needs to go to my kid's dad?


2078
01:18:29,831 --> 01:18:30,151
Okay.


2079
01:18:30,731 --> 01:18:32,171
The one that was over here earlier.


2080
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,011
Just, just hang out right there, man. I'll be
right with you.


2081
01:18:36,631 --> 01:18:36,671
Are you gonna turn around?


2082
01:18:36,671 --> 01:18:37,551
Yeah. Yeah.


2083
01:18:41,051 --> 01:18:41,111
We need to talk to her.


2084
01:18:41,111 --> 01:18:42,331
Hey, just give me a second.


2085
01:18:43,771 --> 01:18:44,151
All right.


2086
01:18:44,191 --> 01:18:45,071
Love you, Lana.


2087
01:18:46,191 --> 01:18:49,611
Is there any way you could cuff me in the
front? I have spinal problems and this really


2088
01:18:50,991 --> 01:18:51,351
hurts. Yeah.


2089
01:18:51,351 --> 01:18:51,571
[laughs]


2090
01:18:51,571 --> 01:18:53,431
Yeah, I can do that. Just, uh, can you turn-


2091
01:18:53,531 --> 01:18:53,551
This will hold your


2092
01:18:53,551 --> 01:18:54,151
Can you turn-


2093
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:57,091
... for me. Just turn


2094
01:18:58,851 --> 01:19:00,651
this.


2095
01:19:00,811 --> 01:19:01,931
Uh, let's see here.


2096
01:19:02,631 --> 01:19:03,271
Uh,


2097
01:19:18,211 --> 01:19:19,751
hang on a second. There we go.


2098
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:23,491
All right, just, uh,


2099
01:19:24,611 --> 01:19:25,591
just like that.


2100
01:19:27,011 --> 01:19:27,471
Yes.


2101
01:19:34,191 --> 01:19:34,971
All right.


2102
01:19:39,966 --> 01:19:43,685
[dominant music] Ravia faced charges for
assault, child endangerment and abuse.


2103
01:19:43,765 --> 01:19:48,146
She pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine
years behind bars on July 23rd,


2104
01:19:48,246 --> 01:19:53,105
2024. No bond was set as she started her
prison time right away.


2105
01:19:53,305 --> 01:19:58,125
The next case will shake you to the core as
two adults were unconscious, possibly dying.


2106
01:19:58,125 --> 01:20:01,905
And somewhere inside the same house, there
was a child alone.


2107
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,665
Hello? Wayne County.


2108
01:20:05,405 --> 01:20:06,085
We're good now.


2109
01:20:07,385 --> 01:20:08,565
Right there's good. Start CPR.


2110
01:20:08,605 --> 01:20:10,666
Start CPR. I've never done it.


2111
01:20:10,785 --> 01:20:11,485
How do you...


2112
01:20:11,685 --> 01:20:16,366
It was just after midnight on November 5th,
2023 when a chilling


2113
01:20:16,545 --> 01:20:21,465
911 call came in. A woman's voice, shaken and
urgent, reported two people


2114
01:20:21,485 --> 01:20:25,325
had overdosed inside a home and there was a
child still in the house.


2115
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:30,326
No one knew if the child was safe. Within
minutes, officers were racing to the scene,


2116
01:20:30,346 --> 01:20:31,645
unsure of what they are about to walk into.


2117
01:20:32,225 --> 01:20:33,805
And then we'll use this on him.


2118
01:20:35,186 --> 01:20:37,045
Just spray it once and then it's done?


2119
01:20:37,225 --> 01:20:37,245
Yeah.


2120
01:20:37,245 --> 01:20:40,065
Ooh. I'm really confused. [breathes heavily]
Perfect. I know.


2121
01:20:40,665 --> 01:20:41,285
Excuse me.


2122
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:42,325
Oh.


2123
01:20:42,365 --> 01:20:45,425
When officers arrived, they found a woman
standing at the door.


2124
01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:48,585
Her hands shaking, eyes wide with fear.


2125
01:20:48,705 --> 01:20:52,025
Inside the home, chaos waited. Two people had
overdosed.


2126
01:20:52,085 --> 01:20:55,185
One of them was completely still, not moving,
not breathing.


2127
01:20:55,605 --> 01:20:56,905
Hi.


2128
01:20:56,905 --> 01:20:56,925
Hi.


2129
01:20:57,305 --> 01:20:58,185
I'm dead.


2130
01:20:58,845 --> 01:21:01,525
What's going on? Hello? Wayne County.


2131
01:21:03,005 --> 01:21:03,165
Can you repeat


2132
01:21:03,825 --> 01:21:03,985
the address?


2133
01:21:04,005 --> 01:21:05,865
Yes, they're there. Uh, they're here.


2134
01:21:05,965 --> 01:21:06,845
I'll respond.


2135
01:21:06,845 --> 01:21:07,905
All right. Both of them?


2136
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:08,905
All right. Thank you. Yes.


2137
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:09,545
What's going on?


2138
01:21:10,605 --> 01:21:11,165
What's going on?


2139
01:21:11,165 --> 01:21:11,425
[screams]


2140
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:13,585
I'm sorry. I'm just trying to swallow.


2141
01:21:13,605 --> 01:21:14,265
Are you okay?


2142
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:15,125
[coughs]


2143
01:21:15,925 --> 01:21:18,945
What's going on? Are you- You too or no? Are
you okay?


2144
01:21:18,945 --> 01:21:20,425
I took a little bit, like, I'm just a little
bit nervous. So I didn't tell you that way.


2145
01:21:20,425 --> 01:21:21,305
Took a little bit of what?


2146
01:21:23,185 --> 01:21:23,565
Okay.


2147
01:21:23,725 --> 01:21:24,965
You know how to work these, right?


2148
01:21:24,965 --> 01:21:26,685
I usually just pass out. But I am a little
dizzy.


2149
01:21:26,725 --> 01:21:27,585
Just spray in the nose.


2150
01:21:27,585 --> 01:21:30,085
It's the same thing as when we were at the
academy.


2151
01:21:30,905 --> 01:21:34,045
You just press that, put one in one nostril
and do...


2152
01:21:34,085 --> 01:21:34,405
Ooh.


2153
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:35,165
In both?


2154
01:21:36,165 --> 01:21:39,865
No, only in one. And then we'll use this on
him.


2155
01:21:41,225 --> 01:21:43,205
Just spray it once and then it's done?


2156
01:21:43,225 --> 01:21:45,145
Yep, just over his, one point.


2157
01:21:46,325 --> 01:21:47,085
Rolling him over.


2158
01:21:48,045 --> 01:21:49,965
Sorry. This isn't good.


2159
01:21:52,725 --> 01:21:56,165
Can we get him in a bedroom or something?
Because I got an ambulance.


2160
01:21:56,185 --> 01:21:57,025
In the bedroom, yeah.


2161
01:21:58,065 --> 01:21:59,545
Can you tell me what this guy's name is?


2162
01:22:00,265 --> 01:22:01,485
Uh, the guy? Yeah.


2163
01:22:03,045 --> 01:22:03,745
Oh. Fuck.


2164
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:05,665
No, not hurt me.


2165
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:07,525
Him? Oh, is she okay?


2166
01:22:08,005 --> 01:22:09,505
We have to put a shot in him.


2167
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:11,265
Oh. Where is he? Where is he?


2168
01:22:12,005 --> 01:22:12,765
Okay. I


2169
01:22:13,445 --> 01:22:14,405
don't see him. I don't see him.


2170
01:22:14,405 --> 01:22:15,385
No, I can get the one,


2171
01:22:16,185 --> 01:22:16,685
on her.


2172
01:22:18,625 --> 01:22:18,645
Get him out of here.


2173
01:22:18,645 --> 01:22:21,365
All right. Do you need to do anything to me?


2174
01:22:22,705 --> 01:22:23,925
I know we're focused on them.


2175
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:29,885
Yeah, of course, my dress. I haven't even


2176
01:22:29,885 --> 01:22:31,845
opened that.


2177
01:22:31,845 --> 01:22:36,785
They stopped breathing. Let's take you
around. Hey, come on in.


2178
01:22:37,685 --> 01:22:39,485
Got two right here. I don't know if you
wanna-


2179
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:39,845
Good lord.


2180
01:22:39,845 --> 01:22:40,845
Did you want us to get one out?


2181
01:22:42,045 --> 01:22:43,245
Tell them we're working two codes.


2182
01:22:43,865 --> 01:22:44,785
CPR that one.


2183
01:22:45,045 --> 01:22:47,045
Okay. Do you want us to pull one out, is what
I'm asking?


2184
01:22:47,385 --> 01:22:50,005
Pull that one, out that one. Start CPR on
her.


2185
01:22:51,045 --> 01:22:52,705
I'm sorry. I don't need to do you all.


2186
01:22:52,845 --> 01:22:53,265
No, you're good. You're good.


2187
01:22:53,525 --> 01:22:55,325
We administered one of both so far.


2188
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:56,765
Okay. You guys have more?


2189
01:22:57,205 --> 01:22:58,605
No, about my way here.


2190
01:22:58,605 --> 01:22:58,925
You ready?


2191
01:22:58,985 --> 01:23:00,105
We have troopers coming in. Oh,


2192
01:23:00,765 --> 01:23:01,465
we're good now.


2193
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:03,925
Right there's good. Start CPR.


2194
01:23:04,545 --> 01:23:06,105
Start CPR. I've never done it.


2195
01:23:06,165 --> 01:23:06,925
How do you...


2196
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,265
Just hang and look at him. There you go.


2197
01:23:11,365 --> 01:23:12,745
Can you get another Narcan charge?


2198
01:23:12,825 --> 01:23:13,525
Yep, just did.


2199
01:23:13,825 --> 01:23:14,645
Do you know how to use this?


2200
01:23:15,265 --> 01:23:17,545
I can probably figure it out. Attach this


2201
01:23:18,265 --> 01:23:20,485
around her neck.


2202
01:23:21,185 --> 01:23:23,025
I don't know if I'm doing it right. This is
my first time.


2203
01:23:23,045 --> 01:23:23,805
You're doing great.


2204
01:23:24,605 --> 01:23:25,065
Keep it up.


2205
01:23:25,265 --> 01:23:26,305
This thing goes in here.


2206
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:27,985
Something like that?


2207
01:23:27,985 --> 01:23:30,825
Yep. Pull it out and it should look like
this. Nice.


2208
01:23:30,825 --> 01:23:32,725
Narcan.


2209
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:34,525
Hey,


2210
01:23:35,965 --> 01:23:36,365
can we get a Narcan?


2211
01:23:36,365 --> 01:23:37,125
Want me to hold for a second?


2212
01:23:37,665 --> 01:23:38,165
Hold for a second.


2213
01:23:39,185 --> 01:23:43,565
Adapt mode. Pull red handle to reveal pads.


2214
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:44,225
Here we go.


2215
01:23:44,605 --> 01:23:44,625
Ready?


2216
01:23:44,625 --> 01:23:46,985
Look at pictures on pads.


2217
01:23:47,945 --> 01:23:52,905
Apply pads to bare skin exactly as shown in
the pictures.


2218
01:23:53,805 --> 01:23:53,825
All right, you got scissors?


2219
01:23:53,825 --> 01:23:54,625
Press pads firmly.


2220
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,285
Anybody got scissors? I don't know.


2221
01:23:57,045 --> 01:23:57,945
Wasn't that cheap though.


2222
01:23:57,985 --> 01:23:58,625
Two here.


2223
01:23:58,705 --> 01:24:01,065
Pull red handle to reveal pads.


2224
01:24:02,145 --> 01:24:04,565
Look at pictures on pads.


2225
01:24:05,425 --> 01:24:05,465
Yeah, thank you.


2226
01:24:05,465 --> 01:24:10,065
Apply pads to bare skin exactly as shown in
the pictures.


2227
01:24:10,465 --> 01:24:11,065
Anybody else?


2228
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:11,305
Yep.


2229
01:24:11,305 --> 01:24:12,905
Press pads firmly.


2230
01:24:13,025 --> 01:24:15,205
Did we check for anybody else in here besides
these two?


2231
01:24:15,225 --> 01:24:17,065
The other girl really had some.


2232
01:24:17,765 --> 01:24:17,805
We have a girl and we have a child.


2233
01:24:17,805 --> 01:24:20,685
Provide chest compressions to the beat.


2234
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:21,145
We got a pulse.


2235
01:24:21,145 --> 01:24:21,425
Got a pulse?


2236
01:24:21,425 --> 01:24:22,185
Yep, we have a pulse.


2237
01:24:23,045 --> 01:24:25,825
One hand should be inside the other hand.


2238
01:24:26,165 --> 01:24:26,185
Is that good enough?


2239
01:24:26,265 --> 01:24:29,445
The other hand should be on top of first
hand.


2240
01:24:29,525 --> 01:24:31,325
Yo, Micah, I've got a pulse over here.


2241
01:24:31,365 --> 01:24:31,965
Press down hard.


2242
01:24:32,065 --> 01:24:32,725
How about over there?


2243
01:24:32,725 --> 01:24:33,405
At least two inches.


2244
01:24:33,405 --> 01:24:34,425
You got a pulse still?


2245
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:35,045
Yep.


2246
01:24:35,285 --> 01:24:35,785
Nice.


2247
01:24:36,565 --> 01:24:39,125
She's, she's finally breathing now. That's
good.


2248
01:24:39,165 --> 01:24:39,685
There we go.


2249
01:24:39,805 --> 01:24:40,605
Hey, working.


2250
01:24:40,785 --> 01:24:42,465
Continue with the patient.


2251
01:24:43,105 --> 01:24:43,725
Hey.


2252
01:24:44,525 --> 01:24:49,305
Hi. There we go. Let's get your head up. Oh,
there we go.


2253
01:24:49,705 --> 01:24:50,725
Hey, can you talk to me?


2254
01:24:50,725 --> 01:24:52,125
Remember to push hard.


2255
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:52,145
Hey.


2256
01:24:52,145 --> 01:24:54,065
I'm gonna sneak behind you real quick. Get a
board.


2257
01:24:54,065 --> 01:24:54,745
What's your name?


2258
01:24:56,865 --> 01:24:57,765
All right, well...


2259
01:24:58,725 --> 01:24:59,625
We're good for now.


2260
01:24:59,645 --> 01:25:01,845
Got that? [laughs] All right.


2261
01:25:02,285 --> 01:25:02,765
Oh, Lord.


2262
01:25:03,225 --> 01:25:04,005
I got more Narcan.


2263
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:05,425
Take another dose for this guy.


2264
01:25:05,845 --> 01:25:06,485
You want me to do it?


2265
01:25:06,525 --> 01:25:08,465
Yeah. Don't worry. I just kinda...


2266
01:25:09,065 --> 01:25:09,525
Got it?


2267
01:25:10,585 --> 01:25:11,065
Here it is.


2268
01:25:12,545 --> 01:25:14,485
Okay. Ready? Go for it.


2269
01:25:15,545 --> 01:25:16,305
There was a kid too.


2270
01:25:16,505 --> 01:25:17,585
Where did that


2271
01:25:17,825 --> 01:25:18,525
She's


2272
01:25:19,865 --> 01:25:20,885
in my apartment next door.


2273
01:25:20,985 --> 01:25:21,925
Okay. Is anyone with her?


2274
01:25:22,185 --> 01:25:22,545
Yes.


2275
01:25:22,565 --> 01:25:23,125
We gotta keep an eye out.


2276
01:25:23,125 --> 01:25:24,125
My girlfriend is with her.


2277
01:25:24,205 --> 01:25:24,645
Okay, good.


2278
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:27,245
Okay. She said she did too. Yeah.


2279
01:25:27,245 --> 01:25:29,165
Yeah. She did. So I'm gonna say if she goes
out...


2280
01:25:29,945 --> 01:25:30,845
And he went up too.


2281
01:25:31,765 --> 01:25:32,805
Yeah. Oh, gosh.


2282
01:25:32,965 --> 01:25:33,525
This is...


2283
01:25:33,525 --> 01:25:34,845
Yeah. It's...


2284
01:25:34,845 --> 01:25:35,745
You're, you're going to jail tonight.


2285
01:25:35,745 --> 01:25:38,645
He's, he's not here. He's on the phone with
her right now.


2286
01:25:39,205 --> 01:25:39,225
Yeah.


2287
01:25:39,225 --> 01:25:40,425
I just didn't want...


2288
01:25:40,759 --> 01:25:42,339
... the kid. [coughs]


2289
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:42,479
Okay.


2290
01:25:42,499 --> 01:25:42,759
You're fine.


2291
01:25:42,759 --> 01:25:43,019
I don't know what happened.


2292
01:25:43,019 --> 01:25:45,439
Granted, she kind of should see this, so
she's down to sh-


2293
01:25:45,700 --> 01:25:46,099
Copy.


2294
01:25:46,559 --> 01:25:47,919
The kid doesn't need to see this.


2295
01:25:48,059 --> 01:25:49,020
Yeah, no, no, I agree.


2296
01:25:49,259 --> 01:25:49,279
No.


2297
01:25:49,279 --> 01:25:50,919
Kid was the one that met me at the door.


2298
01:25:50,939 --> 01:25:51,640
Whose,


2299
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,080
whose kid is this? Their-


2300
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:54,919
He is not here.


2301
01:25:55,379 --> 01:25:55,680
No.


2302
01:25:55,799 --> 01:25:56,800
So who's the mom?


2303
01:25:56,919 --> 01:25:59,979
The mom, the mom is Riley. The mom and the
child are next door.


2304
01:25:59,979 --> 01:25:59,999
Which is next door?


2305
01:25:59,999 --> 01:26:01,080
They are my clients, yes.


2306
01:26:01,220 --> 01:26:01,400
Okay.


2307
01:26:01,519 --> 01:26:05,319
Riley is identified as the mother of the
child in the apartment.


2308
01:26:05,380 --> 01:26:10,120
She explains that people had taken something
that tasted weird, and Amber got dizzy then


2309
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:10,859
passed out.


2310
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,320
Question for ya, what are their names?


2311
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:16,799
I don't know her last name. Amber...


2312
01:26:16,919 --> 01:26:18,279
First, so first name's Amber?


2313
01:26:18,519 --> 01:26:19,380
Yeah, and then-


2314
01:26:19,419 --> 01:26:20,439
What's the dude's name?


2315
01:26:20,859 --> 01:26:22,140
Gates and Baldwin.


2316
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:26,399
Okay, so we got that one right. Hm. And, and,
uh, whose is Amber? Is this girlfriend?


2317
01:26:27,040 --> 01:26:28,819
No, she's a friend of ours.


2318
01:26:28,979 --> 01:26:30,779
Okay. Where is, uh,


2319
01:26:31,579 --> 01:26:32,359
where does she live?


2320
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:34,399
Around here somewhere.


2321
01:26:34,499 --> 01:26:37,999
Okay, so Amber from around here. Do you have
a phone number for her?


2322
01:26:39,419 --> 01:26:39,659
Okay.


2323
01:26:39,659 --> 01:26:41,119
All right, who's talking about getting


2324
01:26:41,119 --> 01:26:41,859
That one.


2325
01:26:42,019 --> 01:26:46,519
No, you keep walking. You don't need to talk.
Okay.


2326
01:26:46,519 --> 01:26:47,019
Ooh,


2327
01:26:47,699 --> 01:26:48,539
I'm really confused.


2328
01:26:48,999 --> 01:26:50,399
I know you are. Easy.


2329
01:26:50,399 --> 01:26:51,819
[sighs] .


2330
01:26:52,419 --> 01:26:53,739
Just remember not to do drugs.


2331
01:26:53,739 --> 01:26:54,559
[coughs]


2332
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:56,059
[laughs] What's your first name?


2333
01:26:56,459 --> 01:26:57,339
Amber.


2334
01:26:57,799 --> 01:26:58,379
Amber? Last name?


2335
01:26:58,539 --> 01:27:00,379
Hollister.


2336
01:27:00,699 --> 01:27:01,619
Amber, how old are you? I'm sorry.


2337
01:27:02,379 --> 01:27:04,559
Um, I don't know. [laughs]


2338
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:06,259
Honey, what's your last name?


2339
01:27:06,539 --> 01:27:07,139
Leagert.


2340
01:27:07,479 --> 01:27:09,799
Uh, they have it, I think.


2341
01:27:10,599 --> 01:27:10,839
I have no idea where I am.


2342
01:27:10,839 --> 01:27:11,679
Okay, Madison's bag?


2343
01:27:11,699 --> 01:27:12,699
Take a couple steps towards me.


2344
01:27:13,099 --> 01:27:13,199
Where's my straw?


2345
01:27:13,199 --> 01:27:15,299
The, the deputy's going to grab it.


2346
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:15,579
Okay.


2347
01:27:15,619 --> 01:27:16,299
Yeah, I'll get it.


2348
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:19,479
Your date of birth, your birthday.


2349
01:27:19,519 --> 01:27:19,779
June 30.


2350
01:27:20,199 --> 01:27:20,619
Okay.


2351
01:27:21,639 --> 01:27:22,159
What year?


2352
01:27:22,859 --> 01:27:24,399
Uh, 2002.


2353
01:27:24,679 --> 01:27:26,459
9/30/2002. All right.


2354
01:27:26,459 --> 01:27:27,179
All right, thank you.


2355
01:27:28,059 --> 01:27:28,179
Make sure you got your ID, sir.


2356
01:27:28,179 --> 01:27:29,479
We got a middle initial, Amber?


2357
01:27:30,719 --> 01:27:31,099
What?


2358
01:27:31,279 --> 01:27:32,739
Do you know what your middle initial is?


2359
01:27:33,059 --> 01:27:33,439
R.


2360
01:27:33,819 --> 01:27:36,459
R? Okay. We gotta bring them on Medica...


2361
01:27:37,039 --> 01:27:38,819
Vehicle back to the accident.


2362
01:27:38,819 --> 01:27:39,859
All right, that dude gone?


2363
01:27:40,139 --> 01:27:40,979
They're ambulating.


2364
01:27:41,439 --> 01:27:42,639
Thank you guys so much.


2365
01:27:42,699 --> 01:27:43,359
Thank you.


2366
01:27:43,599 --> 01:27:43,999
All right.


2367
01:27:43,999 --> 01:27:45,599
Electrode tray connection.


2368
01:27:45,599 --> 01:27:49,079
Good luck. Nice to meet all y'all. What's
your name? Riley Hervers.


2369
01:27:49,239 --> 01:27:49,739
We were


2370
01:27:50,339 --> 01:27:52,019
all drinking a little bit.


2371
01:27:52,059 --> 01:27:52,419
Okay.


2372
01:27:53,099 --> 01:27:56,779
And then they left. I, I wasn't aware.


2373
01:27:56,779 --> 01:27:59,319
I was in the other room trying to put my son
to sleep.


2374
01:27:59,339 --> 01:27:59,619
Yeah.


2375
01:27:59,619 --> 01:28:01,799
As you can see, he's still freaking awake.


2376
01:28:02,479 --> 01:28:06,119
Well, obviously now. I got all the flashing
lights and people running around, so yeah.


2377
01:28:06,239 --> 01:28:07,519
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um,


2378
01:28:08,139 --> 01:28:09,759
so yeah, so they left. I didn't


2379
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:14,479
know what, like, why they left or anything
until they got back.


2380
01:28:14,859 --> 01:28:15,119
Okay.


2381
01:28:15,219 --> 01:28:15,919
And, um,


2382
01:28:16,899 --> 01:28:19,279
they said it tasted weird or whatever.


2383
01:28:19,279 --> 01:28:23,299
[alarm blaring] So I tried, I just put it in
my mouth to try some, um...


2384
01:28:23,779 --> 01:28:25,439
Just, just like a little bit?


2385
01:28:25,619 --> 01:28:25,919
Some of what? Yeah. I, yeah, I put it-


2386
01:28:25,939 --> 01:28:28,479
On the end of like the little or tip of your
finger or something?


2387
01:28:28,479 --> 01:28:31,859
I put it on, yeah, I put like a little bit on
my finger to try it, and it did-


2388
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:32,579
What was it?


2389
01:28:32,779 --> 01:28:36,839
It fucking, it didn't taste right. She got up
and


2390
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:40,539
she said she felt dizzy and went into the
bathroom.


2391
01:28:40,919 --> 01:28:44,139
Um, I don't know if she threw up, but I did
see a little bit.


2392
01:28:44,139 --> 01:28:45,559
There was something on her shirt, yes.


2393
01:28:45,899 --> 01:28:46,579
Yeah, it just, ugh.


2394
01:28:46,579 --> 01:28:46,899
Okay.


2395
01:28:46,979 --> 01:28:48,299
Is that why the water was running?


2396
01:28:48,299 --> 01:28:49,019
[coughs]


2397
01:28:49,019 --> 01:28:50,499
She, she turned the water on or something?


2398
01:28:50,499 --> 01:28:51,359
It don't matter, so.


2399
01:28:51,839 --> 01:28:52,919
Yeah, probably.


2400
01:28:53,079 --> 01:28:53,359
Yeah.


2401
01:28:53,359 --> 01:28:53,379
Yeah.


2402
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:55,019
Probably poured something on them.


2403
01:28:55,019 --> 01:28:55,659
[coughs]


2404
01:28:55,659 --> 01:28:57,999
I remember hearing him try to wake her up.


2405
01:28:58,519 --> 01:29:03,039
I got up like five minutes later to go check
on them, and they were just both


2406
01:29:03,099 --> 01:29:03,919
passed out.


2407
01:29:03,939 --> 01:29:06,959
Unfortunately, it's raining. You okay if we
just get a statement from you quick?


2408
01:29:07,339 --> 01:29:07,639
Yeah.


2409
01:29:07,799 --> 01:29:08,579
About what happened?


2410
01:29:08,879 --> 01:29:09,079
Yeah.


2411
01:29:09,079 --> 01:29:10,359
All right. You wanna start that?


2412
01:29:10,739 --> 01:29:12,599
Yeah. You're okay with the kid in there for
now?


2413
01:29:13,219 --> 01:29:15,759
Yeah. Let me just check on him.


2414
01:29:15,899 --> 01:29:18,759
Yeah, check on him. Make sure they're okay
watching for, like, 10 minutes and then...


2415
01:29:18,999 --> 01:29:22,779
Can I use the bathroom real quick? Do I have
to pay you? Oh, it's okay. I'll just come in


2416
01:29:23,299 --> 01:29:27,259
with you. All right. She's just cleaning up,
so... No, it's okay. Why don't you just


2417
01:29:27,959 --> 01:29:27,999
stay... Are you all right?


2418
01:29:27,999 --> 01:29:29,439
Yeah, just keep the door open, okay? Just
stay-


2419
01:29:29,439 --> 01:29:30,819
You wanna get checked out by an ambulance?


2420
01:29:30,819 --> 01:29:32,259
Yeah, I highly recommend-


2421
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:33,399
What's your name, ma'am?


2422
01:29:33,839 --> 01:29:33,979
Ooh, geez. [door creaking]


2423
01:29:33,979 --> 01:29:35,119
You wanna get checked out by an ambulance?


2424
01:29:35,619 --> 01:29:39,699
Yeah, let's get checked out by EMS, okay?
Yeah, I, yeah, I feel better. I, I can't


2425
01:29:39,699 --> 01:29:41,719
leave him. But it's still- Yeah, I, I
definitely-


2426
01:29:41,739 --> 01:29:41,759
Oh


2427
01:29:41,759 --> 01:29:45,539
... want to get checked out. I just can't
leave him. I don't have anybody to watch him.


2428
01:29:45,959 --> 01:29:47,859
Well, I think at the moment...


2429
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:48,959
Well,


2430
01:29:49,699 --> 01:29:51,379
let's just make sure you're okay.


2431
01:29:51,379 --> 01:29:52,379
Like, let's... Yeah, no, that's fine.


2432
01:29:52,379 --> 01:29:54,219
And we'll cross that bridge when the time
comes, okay?


2433
01:29:54,579 --> 01:29:55,559
Y- yeah. I mean, I think-


2434
01:29:55,559 --> 01:29:58,459
Do you need... Oh, I do actually have to pee.
Can...


2435
01:29:58,479 --> 01:29:59,399
You didn't pee yet? Okay.


2436
01:29:59,399 --> 01:29:59,959
No, I didn't.


2437
01:29:59,959 --> 01:30:00,419
Yeah, just...


2438
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:02,479
Yeah, could you open a crack?


2439
01:30:02,539 --> 01:30:07,359
Yeah, yeah. A detective on scene expresses
concern that Riley may also be


2440
01:30:07,399 --> 01:30:12,179
under the influence and could pass out,
emphasizing the need to find someone to care


2441
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:13,979
for her child. You and your roommate


2442
01:30:14,799 --> 01:30:16,779
were drinking. You wanted to drink, correct?


2443
01:30:17,419 --> 01:30:18,819
He did. I didn't.


2444
01:30:19,299 --> 01:30:19,599
Okay.


2445
01:30:19,619 --> 01:30:24,459
I had, like I said, I had like a couple sips,
but that was it. I was trying to put...


2446
01:30:24,459 --> 01:30:27,079
I was frustrated, trying to put my son to
sleep.


2447
01:30:27,519 --> 01:30:27,799
Yeah.


2448
01:30:28,179 --> 01:30:28,599
So,


2449
01:30:29,619 --> 01:30:31,499
yeah, I drank a little bit, um.


2450
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:32,839
How you feeling right now?


2451
01:30:33,779 --> 01:30:35,259
Are you feeling sick anymore or...


2452
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:36,319
I don't feel sick.


2453
01:30:36,399 --> 01:30:36,759
Okay.


2454
01:30:36,759 --> 01:30:39,639
I just, my vision's a little... I'm a little
slow.


2455
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:41,439
Which is what happened with them, right?


2456
01:30:42,299 --> 01:30:42,499
Okay.


2457
01:30:42,519 --> 01:30:46,019
I think, yeah, I think so. I wasn't really
around them.


2458
01:30:46,039 --> 01:30:48,639
Like, I walked in and they were passed out.


2459
01:30:48,979 --> 01:30:50,479
But you said you tried it, right?


2460
01:30:51,059 --> 01:30:55,459
T- yes. I just tried a little bit on my
finger because they said it tasted weird.


2461
01:30:55,919 --> 01:30:56,239
Yeah.


2462
01:30:56,279 --> 01:30:59,779
So I just try a little bit of it, and then,
like,


2463
01:31:00,419 --> 01:31:04,119
five to 10 minutes later, I kind of started
getting a little


2464
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:09,079
dizzier, T- like, I feel like I'm tipsy.
Like, that's it.


2465
01:31:09,079 --> 01:31:09,279
Yeah.


2466
01:31:09,419 --> 01:31:11,499
Like, I just feel like I'm tipsy right now.


2467
01:31:12,219 --> 01:31:13,399
So I don't know what-


2468
01:31:13,839 --> 01:31:13,859
Yeah.


2469
01:31:13,859 --> 01:31:15,819
... was put in this or whatever.


2470
01:31:16,019 --> 01:31:16,039
Yeah.


2471
01:31:16,059 --> 01:31:19,119
But, and then, yeah, of course, I got sick
and


2472
01:31:19,719 --> 01:31:22,459
just threw up a little bit in there, but I
feel better now.


2473
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:23,639
All right, what's your first name?


2474
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:24,539
Riley.


2475
01:31:24,579 --> 01:31:24,859
Riley.


2476
01:31:24,859 --> 01:31:25,459
Or Ryle or...


2477
01:31:25,519 --> 01:31:28,239
Um, Riley, so my, I'm Detective Roger
LeClaire.


2478
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:31,619
I'm the, the covering the road supervisor for
the sheriff's office,


2479
01:31:32,259 --> 01:31:34,179
uh, tonight. So, um,


2480
01:31:35,159 --> 01:31:39,639
one, forgive my appearance. I don't dress in
a regular uniform on day-to-day basis, okay?


2481
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:41,299
So that's why I'm in regular plain clothes.


2482
01:31:41,439 --> 01:31:43,739
But who were we gonna call to come t-


2483
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:46,245
... take care of your kid for the evening.


2484
01:31:46,605 --> 01:31:46,925
I don't think I-


2485
01:31:46,925 --> 01:31:51,485
We have to call somebody. Right now you're
dozing off with me, just talking to me.


2486
01:31:51,585 --> 01:31:55,786
So to be honest with you, I'm a little
nervous about you, whatever that was,


2487
01:31:56,105 --> 01:32:00,046
affecting you and your breathing and possibly
passing out yourself.


2488
01:32:00,106 --> 01:32:03,225
So we gotta take the ch- child into
consideration.


2489
01:32:03,266 --> 01:32:07,965
So we have to bring, get that kid to someone
that can care for the kid overnight.


2490
01:32:08,266 --> 01:32:09,286
What about Christopher?


2491
01:32:09,425 --> 01:32:09,465
Okay?


2492
01:32:09,465 --> 01:32:11,465
He's out of town. I think-


2493
01:32:11,465 --> 01:32:12,685
Out of town where, then?


2494
01:32:12,925 --> 01:32:17,625
I'm not 100% sure. He's been traveling with,
um, carnivals and


2495
01:32:17,745 --> 01:32:20,365
stuff, like doing like food and stuff, so...


2496
01:32:20,366 --> 01:32:24,605
Okay. All right, we got... Get somebody. Uh,
aunt, great aunt, grandma, grandpa.


2497
01:32:24,645 --> 01:32:27,705
I don't care who. So these people that were
here,


2498
01:32:28,405 --> 01:32:30,205
y- you said you don't, you don't know them
real well?


2499
01:32:31,026 --> 01:32:31,205
Hm.


2500
01:32:32,186 --> 01:32:33,065
No. The


2501
01:32:33,745 --> 01:32:36,306
dude's my temporary, like, roommate.


2502
01:32:36,385 --> 01:32:36,866
Okay.


2503
01:32:37,186 --> 01:32:38,725
Um, and then they-


2504
01:32:38,725 --> 01:32:39,645
And do you know his name?


2505
01:32:40,005 --> 01:32:40,425
Yeah.


2506
01:32:40,545 --> 01:32:41,065
What is it?


2507
01:32:41,206 --> 01:32:45,405
Gates Mboku. It starts with an M. I don't
really know how to,


2508
01:32:45,985 --> 01:32:49,325
um, spell it. So your roommate wanted a
drink.


2509
01:32:49,525 --> 01:32:54,405
So- And, and the cocaine, I guess. But I
didn't know until I


2510
01:32:54,405 --> 01:32:59,285
got back. And I didn't even really want to do
anything, but they said it


2511
01:32:59,385 --> 01:33:00,885
tasted weird. And


2512
01:33:01,565 --> 01:33:06,465
I don't know, I just had a, a feeling. Like,
I probably shouldn't have taken it, but


2513
01:33:06,485 --> 01:33:10,125
I just had like a feeling and I just wanted
to try it too.


2514
01:33:10,525 --> 01:33:13,585
And then, yeah, it did definitely taste
weird. All right.


2515
01:33:13,685 --> 01:33:15,825
Let me go hang this up.


2516
01:33:16,525 --> 01:33:19,225
Riley, where's all the packaging that was
being used?


2517
01:33:20,085 --> 01:33:20,945
Packaging?


2518
01:33:21,225 --> 01:33:24,865
That they used to, they carried the stuff in.
The coke.


2519
01:33:24,985 --> 01:33:28,865
Coke? Uh, there was like a cap- a little
bitty capsule.


2520
01:33:28,865 --> 01:33:32,225
It might still be on the counter.


2521
01:33:33,085 --> 01:33:34,625
Yeah, it's next to the oven.


2522
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:37,805
So they're taking... So were you doing pills
and they're crushing them up? Or...


2523
01:33:38,425 --> 01:33:42,925
No, I think it was... I, I don't know. I
didn't watch any of it happen.


2524
01:33:42,925 --> 01:33:43,605
I just, I didn't-


2525
01:33:43,605 --> 01:33:44,585
Well, what did you do?


2526
01:33:45,185 --> 01:33:47,665
It was on like a little mirror and I, um-


2527
01:33:47,725 --> 01:33:48,905
Put your finger on the mirror?


2528
01:33:48,905 --> 01:33:49,205
Yeah, it was right by-


2529
01:33:49,205 --> 01:33:50,325
So where's that mirror?


2530
01:33:50,725 --> 01:33:53,385
It's in the, um, the drawer.


2531
01:33:54,145 --> 01:33:55,745
It's next to the oven. If you're standing in
front of the oven-


2532
01:33:55,745 --> 01:33:57,505
Oh, okay. So that's all in the kitchen, too?


2533
01:33:57,585 --> 01:33:58,865
Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes.


2534
01:33:58,965 --> 01:34:00,105
Okay, all right. And put him there.


2535
01:34:00,125 --> 01:34:02,185
All right. I got to, um, call his dad.


2536
01:34:02,185 --> 01:34:03,545
I'm gonna close the door. Watch your knees.


2537
01:34:03,545 --> 01:34:05,545
Okay. Can you call your mom?


2538
01:34:06,645 --> 01:34:10,985
They wanna, they wanna take me and like check
me out to make sure I'm okay.


2539
01:34:11,465 --> 01:34:15,885
Who's on their way? Uh, his, um, his grandma.


2540
01:34:16,225 --> 01:34:16,705
Hello?


2541
01:34:18,145 --> 01:34:23,085
Sorry, I don't know your name. [laughs] Am I
able to run in and make him a bag


2542
01:34:23,605 --> 01:34:25,725
for, like an overnight bag?


2543
01:34:26,725 --> 01:34:30,865
No, just because there's gonna be- Yeah,
yeah, yeah. No, when the time comes. Yeah,


2544
01:34:30,865 --> 01:34:34,145
yeah, yeah. No, when the time comes. Yeah,
yeah, yeah. No, we'll... I'll help you out.


2545
01:34:34,265 --> 01:34:35,885
We'll- All right. Thank you. So they're not
letting you out the car?


2546
01:34:37,365 --> 01:34:39,905
No, just because they're still in there.


2547
01:34:41,045 --> 01:34:42,205
So are you being detained?


2548
01:34:42,725 --> 01:34:42,865
N-


2549
01:34:43,765 --> 01:34:48,625
no, I don't think so. Am I being detained? As
of right now, yes, 'cause we're...


2550
01:34:48,625 --> 01:34:51,145
And we're still waiting on EMS, don't forget.
Okay.


2551
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:55,185
So, like, right now you're basically our
responsibility because


2552
01:34:56,285 --> 01:34:58,385
of the situation at hand. I get it. So,


2553
01:34:59,385 --> 01:35:03,925
yeah. I just, I know I made the r- I hope I
made the right decision.


2554
01:35:04,185 --> 01:35:07,785
Honey, yes you did. Yes. You potentially just
saved both of their lives.


2555
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:08,505
She made the right decision.


2556
01:35:08,825 --> 01:35:08,845
Yeah.


2557
01:35:08,845 --> 01:35:09,505
It's okay.


2558
01:35:09,945 --> 01:35:14,805
Yeah, I, I definitely feel bad about it, even
though I didn't really know what was going


2559
01:35:14,885 --> 01:35:18,965
on and everything. No, it's okay. I... You
made the right decision.


2560
01:35:19,345 --> 01:35:23,785
I mean, if you didn't call, who knows where
they'd be right now. Right, right, right.


2561
01:35:24,425 --> 01:35:27,025
And one of the only reasons I did call was
because


2562
01:35:28,505 --> 01:35:33,025
the male, um, has been through this same
experience


2563
01:35:33,105 --> 01:35:37,945
before. Like, I don't- With you? Like- No,
no, no, no, no. Oh, okay.


2564
01:35:37,945 --> 01:35:42,705
Someone else. It was Ham- when actually he
like woke up in the


2565
01:35:42,765 --> 01:35:47,445
hospital the next morning because one of his
friends gave him- You


2566
01:35:47,465 --> 01:35:49,565
said Amber fell on the ground?


2567
01:35:49,565 --> 01:35:51,445
If you wanna hop out, they're here.


2568
01:35:52,185 --> 01:35:53,645
Unless you're gonna follow someone.


2569
01:35:54,165 --> 01:35:55,705
Yeah, but I can hang out.


2570
01:35:55,765 --> 01:35:57,945
Yeah. If you wanna just come see them quick,


2571
01:35:58,725 --> 01:36:01,225
have them check you out in the ambulance.
Probably just be easier.


2572
01:36:01,425 --> 01:36:01,905
Okay.


2573
01:36:02,285 --> 01:36:02,685
Um.


2574
01:36:03,585 --> 01:36:03,885
I can-


2575
01:36:03,885 --> 01:36:05,465
Sorry. Yeah, we, uh-


2576
01:36:05,565 --> 01:36:05,985
What's, what's going on?


2577
01:36:06,045 --> 01:36:08,985
So, um, we, um, we came here for two other
people.


2578
01:36:09,405 --> 01:36:11,265
Unresponsive on the floor, overdoses.


2579
01:36:11,785 --> 01:36:13,505
We got the one girl back, but the, um,


2580
01:36:14,405 --> 01:36:18,785
the male, they gave him like five shots and
was still agonal breathing and they got him


2581
01:36:19,105 --> 01:36:24,005
out of here. But what she's telling me is,
um, uh, is, is all she did was, was she took


2582
01:36:24,005 --> 01:36:26,545
her finger, she, uh, touched the powder


2583
01:36:27,225 --> 01:36:28,945
and um, uh, she just wanted to taste it.


2584
01:36:29,145 --> 01:36:30,945
I'm gonna need you to stay awake for me.


2585
01:36:31,385 --> 01:36:33,745
I'm trying, man. I really am.


2586
01:36:34,665 --> 01:36:36,445
I know you're trying. We don't know what it
was.


2587
01:36:36,525 --> 01:36:39,365
You are gonna go, right? You're gonna go to
the hospital, get checked out?


2588
01:36:40,665 --> 01:36:42,545
No one wants to find you dead later, right?


2589
01:36:43,045 --> 01:36:43,465
Yes. Yes.


2590
01:36:43,485 --> 01:36:44,965
That's the last thing you need for your kid,
right?


2591
01:36:44,965 --> 01:36:48,785
I know, I know. Yeah, I'm totally fine with
it. That was the reason I called.


2592
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:49,185
Okay.


2593
01:36:49,305 --> 01:36:53,985
Riley is taken to the hospital while
neighbors watch her child until the


2594
01:36:54,065 --> 01:36:58,945
grandmother arrives. Officers reassure her
that no one is in trouble, but due to the


2595
01:36:58,965 --> 01:37:02,845
child's presence during the overdose, a child
endangerment report must be filed.


2596
01:37:02,945 --> 01:37:06,465
I got red cross right by my door. Okay.


2597
01:37:06,785 --> 01:37:11,325
So I have your boyfriend's number that's
on... You're on the phone with him? I'm sorry


2598
01:37:11,685 --> 01:37:11,845
to interrupt. So


2599
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:15,525
we're gonna be bringing you to the hospital
almost immediately.


2600
01:37:15,845 --> 01:37:16,585
Is it okay


2601
01:37:17,385 --> 01:37:21,365
if it's okay with them that your neighbors
watch your kid until whoever shows up?


2602
01:37:21,765 --> 01:37:24,785
Yeah, that's fine. Okay. I just have to pack
a bag for him.


2603
01:37:24,865 --> 01:37:28,065
Like, we don't have anything at our house.
Okay.


2604
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,945
Where is his stuff in your apartment?


2605
01:37:30,265 --> 01:37:33,185
When grandma comes, why can't grandma go in
the apartment and pack up the shit?


2606
01:37:35,285 --> 01:37:35,485
She doesn't know where anything is. I mean, I
could try.


2607
01:37:35,485 --> 01:37:37,185
She'll figure it out though. She's a grandma,
right?


2608
01:37:37,645 --> 01:37:37,665
Yeah, I guess.


2609
01:37:37,665 --> 01:37:38,665
I mean,


2610
01:37:38,865 --> 01:37:42,105
how hard is it, right? Some diapers, some
clothes, throw it in a bag and call it good.


2611
01:37:42,645 --> 01:37:47,585
I mean, they're, they're all in this room. Is
it okay if you guys watch the kid until the


2612
01:37:47,865 --> 01:37:47,885
grandma comes? Yeah.


2613
01:37:47,885 --> 01:37:49,625
Okay. Because she's gonna be going to the
hospital.


2614
01:37:51,251 --> 01:37:52,331
... pretty urgent. So,


2615
01:37:53,012 --> 01:37:54,691
I just wanna make sure it's okay with you
guys.


2616
01:37:54,691 --> 01:37:54,711
Yeah.


2617
01:37:54,711 --> 01:37:57,252
And I'm, I gotta get in contact with the
woman.


2618
01:37:57,271 --> 01:37:57,451
But,


2619
01:37:58,092 --> 01:37:58,491
um-


2620
01:38:00,831 --> 01:38:02,811
Why are you asking if I can take care of him?


2621
01:38:02,971 --> 01:38:03,551
We don't know-


2622
01:38:03,591 --> 01:38:05,311
Are there any families coming to get him?


2623
01:38:05,771 --> 01:38:09,371
No, he just really needs a diaper change. So
bad.


2624
01:38:09,811 --> 01:38:13,432
Okay, yeah. We're trying to figure out right
now, like a diaper bag situation.


2625
01:38:13,752 --> 01:38:17,092
I'm not sure if you'd be willing to change
his diaper or what, but I-


2626
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:17,372
We don't have


2627
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,472
have


2628
01:38:18,572 --> 01:38:19,572
a changing table.


2629
01:38:19,672 --> 01:38:20,672
I no idea what you guys are going to do.


2630
01:38:20,772 --> 01:38:20,931
Do you know if his mama's coming?


2631
01:38:21,751 --> 01:38:24,711
Yeah. But you guys are great people for doing
this.


2632
01:38:27,471 --> 01:38:27,611
Oh, thank you so much. I wish I was there.


2633
01:38:27,611 --> 01:38:29,711
I know, he doesn't deserve to go through it.


2634
01:38:30,731 --> 01:38:31,271
So...


2635
01:38:31,352 --> 01:38:32,091
Hey, Riley.


2636
01:38:32,332 --> 01:38:32,611
Hey.


2637
01:38:32,631 --> 01:38:33,832
How's it going? Can we talk to you?


2638
01:38:34,152 --> 01:38:34,652
Yeah.


2639
01:38:34,891 --> 01:38:36,991
How's, how's everybody doing?


2640
01:38:37,371 --> 01:38:37,811
We're good.


2641
01:38:37,832 --> 01:38:38,572
Everybody's alive?


2642
01:38:38,771 --> 01:38:39,832
Yes [laughs] . Yeah, it's crazy.


2643
01:38:39,832 --> 01:38:40,352
That's good.


2644
01:38:40,411 --> 01:38:41,551
Everybody's alive [laughs] .


2645
01:38:41,551 --> 01:38:44,011
What's up, bud? So, he said Gates is coming
back?


2646
01:38:44,251 --> 01:38:44,911
Yeah, he is.


2647
01:38:44,931 --> 01:38:45,252
Okay.


2648
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,651
Did you... You tested what was in there?


2649
01:38:47,891 --> 01:38:49,032
Did you, um-


2650
01:38:49,032 --> 01:38:53,951
[sighs] So, as far as the drugs go, it's not
something where we're gonna


2651
01:38:53,971 --> 01:38:55,131
charge anybody with it.


2652
01:38:55,191 --> 01:38:56,091
Well, I just wanted to know what was in
there.


2653
01:38:56,091 --> 01:38:57,171
Even if we wanted to-


2654
01:38:57,391 --> 01:38:57,792
I, I-


2655
01:38:57,872 --> 01:38:58,531
No, because-


2656
01:38:58,531 --> 01:38:58,971
... you can't tell me?


2657
01:38:58,971 --> 01:39:00,292
Not... So, here's the, here's the thing.


2658
01:39:00,391 --> 01:39:04,791
When, uh, when, whenever we do these tests
for them, it's like a stupid amount of money


2659
01:39:05,451 --> 01:39:06,232
anymore. Oh [laughs] .


2660
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:07,691
So, you know, it's, that's, you know-


2661
01:39:07,991 --> 01:39:08,011
Oh.


2662
01:39:08,011 --> 01:39:08,231
And-


2663
01:39:08,231 --> 01:39:12,572
Because they tested me at the hospital and I,
it only um, cocaine and


2664
01:39:12,651 --> 01:39:17,511
marijuana came up in my system. And they told
Gates at the hospital that he was definitely


2665
01:39:17,511 --> 01:39:18,071
like, laced with something.


2666
01:39:18,111 --> 01:39:18,392
Yeah.


2667
01:39:18,632 --> 01:39:19,531
But it didn't show up in my system.


2668
01:39:19,531 --> 01:39:20,551
Well, you know when they-


2669
01:39:20,551 --> 01:39:25,311
But I, I don't know because she tested me
very, like later after I showed up and


2670
01:39:25,311 --> 01:39:25,592
stuff.


2671
01:39:25,611 --> 01:39:29,251
Well so, so most... So whenever they do take
the final splice of that it's, it's, it's not


2672
01:39:29,271 --> 01:39:33,031
always a perfect mix, right? So, he could
have a bull... So, I, um, all you guys are


2673
01:39:33,031 --> 01:39:37,151
doing with... Well, what they were doing like
was lines. Like, I'm like, it, it could've


2674
01:39:37,151 --> 01:39:38,111
been a little bit. I, yeah, I didn't... I put
some in my mouth.


2675
01:39:38,131 --> 01:39:38,851
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.


2676
01:39:38,892 --> 01:39:41,671
I didn't even... I just didn't know if that
was a different...


2677
01:39:41,671 --> 01:39:45,291
Because I didn't snort any, I put some in my
mouth is what I was trying to say.


2678
01:39:45,291 --> 01:39:45,832
Okay. Looks like you're trying to be
Superman.


2679
01:39:45,832 --> 01:39:47,811
[laughs] Jesus Christ.


2680
01:39:47,991 --> 01:39:50,311
But yeah, I probably wouldn't touch it
anymore, obviously, right?


2681
01:39:50,331 --> 01:39:50,511
If I-


2682
01:39:50,552 --> 01:39:51,391
Yes, of course [laughs] .


2683
01:39:51,391 --> 01:39:54,291
If I scared the crap out of you. You go in
there and see your friends on the ground.


2684
01:39:54,291 --> 01:39:58,371
Yes [laughs] . Of course. I'm sure he had a
good night with grandma either way, so- Yeah,


2685
01:39:58,371 --> 01:40:01,011
he had a good night with grandma either way,
so- Yeah, he did. He had a great night with


2686
01:40:01,072 --> 01:40:03,652
his grandma. He definitely did. Did, did they
keep you there all night or did you come home


2687
01:40:03,671 --> 01:40:07,731
in the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's
in the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep


2688
01:40:07,831 --> 01:40:12,331
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's
in the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's i


2689
01:40:12,331 --> 01:40:13,091
n the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's


2690
01:40:13,091 --> 01:40:16,251
in the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's i


2691
01:40:16,251 --> 01:40:18,992
n the morning? No, I, yeah. They didn't keep
me there all night. I came back. Yeah, he's


2692
01:40:19,452 --> 01:40:19,751
in Penfield. He just got his food. He got
Mexican... Oh, he probably went to that Monte


2693
01:40:20,031 --> 01:40:23,632
Alban's. Yeah, yeah, so- So, that's not too
far. It's like a 10-minute drive from here.


2694
01:40:23,632 --> 01:40:23,731
So yeah, he'll probably be here in like, 20
minutes maybe. Okay. All right, sounds good.


2695
01:40:24,491 --> 01:40:27,151
I don't know if I was going to take too long
or not. We'll, uh... No one's in trouble for


2696
01:40:27,632 --> 01:40:31,691
like, the drugs and stuff like that, right?
You, you guys are, you went through a


2697
01:40:31,691 --> 01:40:32,011
traumatic experience. We're not doing
anything with that. Yeah.


2698
01:40:32,011 --> 01:40:32,371
All right?


2699
01:40:32,991 --> 01:40:33,011
Yeah.


2700
01:40:33,011 --> 01:40:35,931
So, I just wanted to let you guys know that.
Because that f- what of us...


2701
01:40:36,411 --> 01:40:39,191
Um, I'm assuming that you thought it was
coke, I'm guessing.


2702
01:40:39,472 --> 01:40:39,671
Yeah.


2703
01:40:39,671 --> 01:40:41,271
Probably, right? Yeah, so...


2704
01:40:41,972 --> 01:40:46,471
Here's what we got to do though. Because, and
again, I'm gonna work with you guys.


2705
01:40:46,471 --> 01:40:48,391
I, I just, I want you to listen to me, okay?


2706
01:40:48,431 --> 01:40:48,451
Okay.


2707
01:40:49,311 --> 01:40:54,151
So, because there was a child here, we do
have to do, we do have to,


2708
01:40:54,271 --> 01:40:57,152
we have to do what's an endangerment. That's
why CPS was here.


2709
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:57,371
Okay.


2710
01:40:57,371 --> 01:41:02,192
So what I want to do tonight is I want to
get, I want, hi, hi, I want to get you what's


2711
01:41:02,612 --> 01:41:06,911
taken care of. And then uh, you, we're gonna
have to try to do like, an appointment or


2712
01:41:06,911 --> 01:41:11,672
something. Because I'm, I'm not gonna take
your child with us. But it's something that


2713
01:41:11,672 --> 01:41:14,451
we have to do. This isn't a... This really
isn't an option.


2714
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:19,612
If it was, maybe we'd go a different way but
we don't really have a choice with this


2715
01:41:19,672 --> 01:41:22,412
one. Which would help, which is, which is why
I wanted you to eat first.


2716
01:41:22,431 --> 01:41:25,711
So, at least you get that and at least I get
that in there, so...


2717
01:41:26,131 --> 01:41:29,012
And obviously, we'll have to give a little to
Amber at some point too.


2718
01:41:29,512 --> 01:41:33,991
It's just an A misdemeanor and normally they
don't really do anything with them anyways,


2719
01:41:34,151 --> 01:41:36,831
so... But it is something we have to go
through.


2720
01:41:37,111 --> 01:41:41,112
We'll, we'll bring you down tonight, get that
taken care of and then you don't gotta worry


2721
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,692
about it. And then, I don't know if you can
get someone,


2722
01:41:44,331 --> 01:41:45,291
someone tomorrow


2723
01:41:46,091 --> 01:41:46,591
maybe?


2724
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:47,891
Maybe watch him?


2725
01:41:47,891 --> 01:41:52,492
Or if, even if you want to, we can meet you
down there because you have a


2726
01:41:52,532 --> 01:41:52,931
car?


2727
01:41:53,851 --> 01:41:55,592
Yeah, that's my other driver.


2728
01:41:55,631 --> 01:41:59,111
Okay, so... Do you have anything you need to
bring?


2729
01:41:59,291 --> 01:42:01,691
Obviously, you probably want your phone and
wallet, right?


2730
01:42:01,791 --> 01:42:02,071
Mm-hmm.


2731
01:42:02,191 --> 01:42:04,012
Got anything else, or... Probably gonna-


2732
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:06,152
I was just, yeah, she's got stuff from


2733
01:42:06,191 --> 01:42:06,652
Hey, hey.


2734
01:42:06,771 --> 01:42:08,251
Yeah, no. If you wanna, wanna throw that
away.


2735
01:42:08,251 --> 01:42:08,611
Yeah.


2736
01:42:08,691 --> 01:42:11,252
Unfortunately, we're, we're coming off work,
we're gonna follow you around like


2737
01:42:12,072 --> 01:42:12,891
a bunch of creepers,


2738
01:42:13,492 --> 01:42:14,091
but...


2739
01:42:15,691 --> 01:42:16,011
Hey, hey.


2740
01:42:16,031 --> 01:42:16,971
Why are you yelling at me?


2741
01:42:17,112 --> 01:42:18,332
I didn't do anything.


2742
01:42:18,732 --> 01:42:20,672
No, just ditch whatever you don't want to
bring.


2743
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:22,051
My toys.


2744
01:42:22,051 --> 01:42:23,491
He's afraid you're gonna steal his toys.


2745
01:42:23,511 --> 01:42:23,911
Yeah.


2746
01:42:24,592 --> 01:42:25,791
Don't need to bring your money, right?


2747
01:42:25,791 --> 01:42:26,531
[laughs]


2748
01:42:27,131 --> 01:42:27,432
Look.


2749
01:42:27,592 --> 01:42:28,912
Yeah, definitely leave that there.


2750
01:42:29,311 --> 01:42:31,651
He's got a lot of toys. The most of any kid
I've seen.


2751
01:42:31,691 --> 01:42:35,891
The woman was charged with acting in a manner
injurious to a child less than


2752
01:42:35,991 --> 01:42:36,751
17.


2753
01:42:38,811 --> 01:42:43,411
Well, if there is one thing we've learned
from these cases, it's that no matter how


2754
01:42:43,511 --> 01:42:48,391
unpredictable life gets, law enforcement is
always on their front lines facing the


2755
01:42:48,471 --> 01:42:53,412
unimaginable. From shocking moments of
neglect to life-altering decisions, these


2756
01:42:53,431 --> 01:42:56,471

spiral out of control.
